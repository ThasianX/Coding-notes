### Books 1-4

- Be honest. Don’t lie. This will help me improve my character and integrity
- Be the same in all circumstances. Pain, victory, fame. Only the logos matters. This will help me develop greater strength and flexibility
- Don’t constantly correct people. Just answer their question or add another example. This will help me develop more friendships since people don’t like to admit they’re wrong.
- Optimism in adversity. This will help when cold approaching as I know that even if I do get rejected, I know I have still brightened the girl’s day
- Do a job without whining. This will help me develop that mental fortitude and acceptance that this is just the way of events. Since complaining isn’t going to help, why not just make the most out of it
- Having a sense of when to push and when to back off. This will help mainly in day game as I want to be pulling in the beginning and then recognizing that point where she’s hooked and then pushing and closing
- Handling material comforts. If they are there, I will take advantage of them. If not, I won’t miss them. This will help me keep my mind on the right track and not caught up in the superficial.
- Just start doing what needs doing and not the credit gained from doing it. This will really orient me in the right track for a good character

### Book 4

- When something unfortunate happens to you, reverse your thought immediately and think, this is fortunate that it happened to me and not someone else. It could’ve happened to anyone but not anyone would’ve remained unharmed by it. To endure misfortune is great fortune
- On death, think of all the people who have died toiling away from their lives, dying so old. Our life is so short. 3 days or 3 generations? There is no difference. So live your life. Live in the present

### Book 5

- Practice virtues you can show: one I need to practice is moderation.
- Do what needs doing
- Things that happen to us are ordered. It furthers our destiny. Accept what happens to you because it leads to the common good: nature would never bring something that wasn’t beneficial to the whole.
- Embrace the moments in life where you don't look so great. Every action of yours doesn't have to be cool, wise: after all, you're just human and imperfect but embrace the pursuit that you've embarked on
- In life, the people around you may be hard to put up with. But that's fine. Take refuge in yourself, knowing that all things that happen to you are natural and that you have the choice to not do things you don't want to.
- Being with other people is one of our daily occupations. Sometimes, they will impede us. But that is fine. "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."
- If it doesn't harm the greater community, then it cannot harm you.

> Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone-those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the "what" is in constant flux, the "why" has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what's right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us-a chasm whose depths we cannot see. So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.

- When other people hurt you, it's their character that suffers, not yours.
- 2 characteristics shared between men and god: to not let anyone hold you back and to locate the goodness in thinking and doing the right things
- good fortune is not given but created: good character, good intentions and good actions

### Book 6

- Focus on the state of your own mind, the mind that avoids selfishness and works with others to achieve goals.
- just focus on what you need to do and You won’t be tempted by anything else. Jealousy is only going to lead you to your end. Prizing your own mind is the best path
- The only rewards of our life are a virtuous character and unselfish acts
- Focus on the source of where all things come from
- We often label certain outcomes and actions as good or bad and tend to blame others for them. But what if we just limited our perception of good and bad as our own actions? Then you would have no one to blame but yourself
- whatever happens to a single person is for the good of others
- To live our lives out truthfully and rightly and to have patience with others who don’t
- when we need encouragement, we should look to the qualities of people around us possess and how we can achieve those same virtues
- Our efforts are really subject to circumstances and we need a proper gauge of what counts as a success: to try. To try is to succeed.

> Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that just happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions.

- Practice hearing what people are really trying to say

### Book 7

- Our worth is measured by what we devote our energy and time to
- To not just act a certain way but to be a certain way. We have the power within to be virtuous and we don’t need to behave straightened, unlike our actual selves
- Something can only hurt you if you choose to interpret it as harmful
- Perceptions are harmful. See things for what they really are. Don’t judge
- the ability to recognize that people do bad things or make mistakes because they’re human. Accepting that and understanding they haven’t really hurt you is powerful
- when someone hurts you, have sympathy for them because they have only hurt themselves

> Discard your misperceptions. Stop being jerked like a puppet. Limit yourself to the present. Understand what happens - to you, to others. Analyze what exists, break it all down: material and causes. Anticipate your final hours. Other people’s mistakes? Leave it to their makers.

> To labor cheerfully and so endure the wind that blows from heaven

- Let your actions be not influenced by others and only by nature. All things were made for a higher being. Resist your body’s urges. Avoid rashness and think.
- Resolve to live up to your own expectations
- when you experience pain, one thing that can help is thinking about the limits of the pain and not magnifying them based on physical sensations. Another thing you can do is to remind yourself that “I’m giving into pain”
- don’t expect things in exchange for kindness

### Book 8

- Think in first principles - good and evil. Good being what leads to fairness, and self control and virtuous qualities.
- know the what, why and how for yourself
- you weren’t born for pleasure
- You have the option to do something today yet you choose to leave it for tomorrow.
- 3 relationships: one with yourself, one with god, and one with people
- assemble your life, action by action.
- to accept without arrogance and to let go with indifference
- Any rational being can take a setback and make it into a learning experience
- Pleasure is different for everyone: keeping your mind clear, not shying away from people and things you should be doing, and accepting everything that comes your way
- Stop living for your posthumous moments. Live in the present. Why should you care about what people say or think about you many years later
- Stick with first impressions. Don’t extrapolate. So if someone’s just insulted you, you just notice that you’ve been insulted but it hasn’t harmed you
- patience, humility, and honesty. The three qualities you need to win freedom
- Do you really want the praise of people who kick themselves nearly every twenty minutes, people who despise themselves and what they do?
- You have two choices with people: either instruct them or endure them. The former is always a win as you never know what might happen

### Book 9

- To do harm to someone else is to do harm to yourself
- Objective judgement, unselfish action, and willing acceptance of the events that occur in life
- anxiety is just a perception. You can easily discard it
- Not being done to but doing
- let other people fix their own mistakes
- throughout life, we all transform: childhood, youth, adulthood, old age. The end of each stage is a death and the beginning of the next is a new beginning. Think of death not as an end but as a transformation.
- Remind yourself of your own goals and beliefs. Remind yourself of the world and what you’re part of.
- when faced with insults from someone, try to understand why he’s doing what he’s doing, and wish him well because he’s the same being as you
- Go do what nature demands of you and don’t expect anything in return
- indifference to external actions and a commitment to justice in your own actions, meaning that they result in the greater good
- enough whining. The purpose of your life is clear
- Start changing the way you pray to god. Stop praying for things to happen and start praying to not feel fear, desire, and grief.
- Concentrate on what you’re doing. Don’t let your mind be influenced by external feelings
- why be surprised if someone is untrustworthy or a certain way? Don’t call other people ungrateful when it’s you who should’ve noticed that they didn’t deserve your trust in the first place. You were given logos for a reason: to see things as they are. And when helping others and not getting a reward in return, isn’t it enough that you did your duty as a human? Your eyes and feet don’t expect rewards for what they do and you shouldn’t either when you help others.

### Book 10

- Stop complaining and be satisfied with what you have in the present. Accept that all things are good and everything is the gift of gods.
- you can endure anything if it is of your mind’s interest to do so.
- everything that’s happened to you was destined
- nothing that benefits the whole can harm the parts. Think of yourself as a part of the whole you form. Then you’ll come to accept everything that happens to you. Then you’ll start acting in ways that benefit the whole, unselfishness, cooperative actions.
- epithets for yourself: modest. Upright. Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. Disinterest, as in not interested in fame, money, superficial things
- Ask yourself these 2 questions: are what you are doing now the right thing? Do you accept and welcome what you’ve been assigned?
- Does it make any difference if other people blame you for doing what’s right?
- Stop preaching about what the good man should be like and start being one
- every one of us needs what nature gives us, when nature gives it to us. Be patient in the meantime
- To see daily forces at work when they create sensations as we eat and work and procreate
- When faced with people’s bad behavior, think of times when you were also like that. Let your anger subside as you realize that they were acting under compulsion just as you were
- enjoyment is doing more of what nature requires of you. Using your logos more to keep your eyes fixed on the right path
- we are but mere leaves blown by the wind. None of us have much time left and yet we think we do
- a healthy mind a should be prepared for anything. Be prepared for haters, lovers, surprises, as that will help you increase your mental fortitude
- start asking “why” to everything, starting with your own actions

### Book 11

- The rational mind analyzes everything in life and then becomes indifferent. Indifference to pretty singing, dancing, martial arts, etc
- Stay focused on doing things for the common good.
- People will stop you as you do what is right for the whole and that's fine. Have some tolerance. Don't feel anger: anger is a sign of weakness.
- Other people's perceptions and actions toward you are their own problem. You just have to remain the same - still nice and patient, seeking to correct their wrongs.
- Keep in mind the parts and whole.We can choose to make perceptions about them and choose not to. Macro vision, micro actions
- You never know for sure that what the other person said is a mistake. Keep in mind how much you don't know
- It's not so much what others say or do to us but our own misperceptions of them. Discard your perceptions. Realize you've suffered no disgrace
- to expect bad people to not do bad things is just ignorance. And to expect them to exempt you from their bad acts is arrogant of you
- for every thought, ask if the thought is unnecessary, a product of the thinking around you, or destructive to the people around you
- To complain, feel anger, indulge, or feel fear are all actions that go against nature. You were created to show reverence for the divine and that means accepting all that happens as nature's command
- Your goal should be a common one and all your energy should be devoted towards that. In turn, your actions will too as well as you
- As a host, give your guests the very best and yourself what's left
- Steer clear of any desire and try to moderate your impulses, making sure they benefit others

### Book 12

- Let go of the past, leave the future to fate, and entrust the present to the gods and the truth
- Cut your mind free from impressions that cling to the mind and start concentrating on what can be lived
- We value other people's opinion about us more than our own. It shouldn't be like that.
- To see things as they are: substance, cause, and purpose
- It's all in how you perceive things. You are in control
- Keep in mind: that your actions are not arbitrary and with purpose, that things happen because of fate and you can't complain, that all things return to where they came from, and that feeling arrogant is pointless
- don't boast about your humility. Do the things you were born to do - uprightness, self control, obedience to god - without making a scene out of it
