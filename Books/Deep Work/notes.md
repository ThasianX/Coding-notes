### The Benefits

### Chapter 1: Deep work is valuable

- 3 groups of people that will succeed: high skilled workers, superstars, and owners
- Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy: the ability to quickly master hard things and the ability to produce at an elite level - quality and speed wise
- If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive. To be an elite, you have to transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value
- These 2 core abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work
- Deliberate practice: your attention has to be focused on a certain skill you’re trying to improve or idea you’re trying to master and you have to receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive
- By having this focused attention, you develop more myelin around relevant neurons, the physical mechanism that drives improvements on hard tasks. Diffused attention through working while distracted fires off too many circuits simultaneously which makes it hard to isolate the group of neurons you want to strengthen
- High quality work produced=(Time spent) * (Intensity of focus)
- Attention residue: a residue of your attention that remains stuck thinking about the original task
- Deep work minimizes the negative effects of attention residue

### Chapter 2: Deep work is rare

- The present day trends like instant messaging are undercutting deep work - actively decreasing one’s ability to go deep
- As knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts
- The metric black hole: an opaque region resistant to measurements related to deep work. The metric black hole prevents the realization that distraction based behaviors are hurting one’s ability to work productively and allows the shift toward distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world
- Principle of least resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment
- Basically, it’s easier. The quick responsiveness to your needs makes it easier. The culture of connectivity creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox, making your life easier. Planning is too hard. Waiting is too hard.
- Busyness as a proxy for productivity: In the absence of clear indicator of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner(emails, scheduling meetings, etc).
- The cult of the internet: a culture of technopoly leads to a seductive ideology that if a behavior relates to the internet, then it must be good. The disadvantage of this way of thinking is that it directly undermines core values of deep work like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery.
- All these trends are enabled by the difficulty of directly measuring the value of depth or the cost of ignoring it

### Chapter 3: Deep work is meaningful

- In the past, there was a very clear connection between deep work and a good life, as portrayed by a master craftsman. But in today’s society, this connection is very unclear. One reason is because of how much harder it is to define exactly how one knowledge worker’s work differs from another as their work consists mostly of emails and powerpoint. Another reason for this lack of clarity is that there are just a cacophony of voices telling workers to spend more time in shallow activities like social media, email, and instant messaging. But just because it’s hard to define the connection between depth and meaning in today’s society, it doesn’t mean you can’t. There are 3 arguments for why a deep life is one that is not just economically lucrative but also a life well lived.
- Neurological perspective: too often, we are focused on the circumstances that shape us in life. We don't really pay attention to the small accomplishments but we put more emphasis on the bigger ones like getting a bigger house or getting diagnosed with cancer. This is a life that is destined to lead to unhappiness as you will always be accepting stimuli from everywhere, positive or negative. But by focusing your attention selectively, you can tune out negative stimuli. You are what you think. Don’t let a major event like cancer change the way you think. It’s only bad if you think it’s bad. What you focus on after can really provide a reset button to the turmoil of feelings. How does this relate to deep work? Simple. If you spend enough time in a state of depth, then you will view your world as more enriching and meaningful. You will be able to constantly be in a state where you can ignore the smaller things that occur in life that populate the lives of shallow workers. This will allow you to be more efficient in life. Neurologically speaking, a day driven by shallow work will be one that will probably be draining and upsetting. This is why being in a state of depth will drive greater satisfaction and meaning to your working life.
- Psychological Argument: A group of psychologists surveyed a sample of people to test when they were feeling the best in the day. The study concluded that people feel more satisfaction and enjoyment at work than free time at home. This is because the act of going into a flow state, losing oneself in an activity after intense concentration, is simply rewarding. This theory is agnostic towards the content of the person’s attention and solely focused on the enriching experience provided by going deep. Build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work.
- Philosophical argument: Two well known philosophical professors wrote a book which explores how sacredness has evolved over time. In it, they mention how after the post-enlightenment, people have started tasking themselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not meaningful. This embrace of an autonomous life is inevitably boring and nihilist in nature. In contrast, they noted how the craftsman doesn’t decide which parts of the objects he crafts are valuable, but rather cultivates the ability to extract the inherent value from the object. Even in today’s society, this sort of unique experience can happen in any job. Too often, we are caught up in our job descriptions. This is the fault that prevents one from experiencing the same thing as the craftsman. Rather, one needs to realize that they don’t need a rarified job; they need a rarified approach to their work. One thing noticeable about the craftsman is that to be able to extract value, he has to be in a state of depth to cultivate his skill.
- A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.

### The Rules

### Work deeply

- I use the rhythmic approach to deep work. Every morning I wake up and start my deep work session. I employ a calendar to track my progress and keep me motivated
- I also use the 4DX rules for deep work. Focusing on the wildly important, acting on lead measures(in this case, the amount of hours devoted to deep work), keeping a compelling scoreboard(my calendar with number of hours spent on deep work everyday), and creating a cadence of accountability(reviewing my deep work hours every week to see what i can improve on)
- Setting a shut down time and ritual

### Embrace boredom

- Insignificant actions like checking your phone in line or looking at social media sporadically can counteract your efforts to improve your ability to go deep
- Schedule internet blocks to minimize the effort of switching from a high intensity task to a low intensity task. In line, just wait and be bored - it’s novel.
- Impose artificial deadlines on yourself as it can allow you to work in a state of intense concentration and avoid distraction
- Productive meditation can help reinforce the attention muscles. On a walk, think of the relevant variables to a problem you have. Define the question for how you can solve the problem using the variables. Then, consolidate your solution by reviewing the answer you found. Be aware of distracting thoughts(just gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later) and looping(mind looping through info you know and not finding new solutions)
- Mind palace technique is also good for memorizing. Rote is bad.
- When eliminating shallow work, a question you have to ask yourself to judge the value of work is: “How long would it take(in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?” Once I figure out where my current activities fall within this shallow-deep scale, I’ll bias myself more towards the latter.
- Schedule every minute of your work day. Use the left column of journal for time slots(1 line represents 30 min) and right side for batched tasks for a box.
- When sending emails or texts out, in a professional context, ask yourself this: “What is the ‘project’ represented by this message, and what is the most efficient(in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this ‘project’ to a successful conclusion?” Project of course can be anything like coffee, a meeting, or research. Even when crafting a new email, make sure there is clarity in the message(no ambiguity), why the message makes sense(why the receiver would even comply to your message), and the receiver doesn’t have to do much to respond.
