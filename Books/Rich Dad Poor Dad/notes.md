### Introduction

- Being rich or poor is just a mindset
- Rich people think
    - How can I afford it
    - Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't produce
    - Study hard so you can find a good company to buy
    - Learn to manage risk
    - My house is a liability
    - Financial self-reliance
    - Write strong business and financial plans so I can create jobs
    - There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal
    - Money is power
- Poor people think
    - I can't afford it
    - The rich should pay more in taxes to help the less fortunate
    - Study hard so you can find a good company to work for
    - When it comes to money, play safe. Don't take risks.
    - Our home is our largest investment, and our greatest asset
    - I've worked hard for the government and I'm entitled to all these benefits
    - Write good resumes so I can find a good job
    - I'll never be rich
    - Money doesn't matter

- Financial education is more powerful than money
    - With it, you can always build wealth, even if you have no money

### Lesson 1: The Rich Don't work for Money

- The faster you can make a decision, the more likely you'll be able to seize opportunities
- Some people just let life push them. Others get angry and push back
- Most people want everyone else but themselves to change. But it's much easier to change yourself

> The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them

- True learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire
- People's lives are controlled by money: the fear of the lack of money drives them to work hard to earny money but once they get the paycheck, greed or desire causes them to spend the money they just earned. This cycle perpetuates
- Be an observer, not a reactor to your emotions
    - When a person says, "I need to find a job", it's most likely an emotion doing the thinking. The fear of not having money generates that thought
    - Instead of waking up and going to work because of the fear of not paying your bills, ask yourself "Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?"
    - When emotions go up, intelligence goes down
- A job is really just a short term solution to a long term problem
- We're all employees ultimately. We just work at different levels
- What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. Ignorance stems from your perception of money

### Lesson 2: Why Teach Financial Literacy?

- Intelligence solves problems and produces money. But money without financial intelligence is money soon gone
- It's not how much money you make. It's how much money you keep
- If you want to be rich, accounting will be your most important subject

> Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets

- An asset is something that puts money in your pocket whether you work or not
- A liability is something that takes money out of your pocket
- Most people have trouble with how they choose to spend the money they do have
    - If they would just look at their decisions in the mirror and ask themselves, "Does this make sense?"
    - If they would notice that they were just following the crowds

> An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is

- A house is not an asset. It's a liability
    - The additional expenses that go along with owning a house - mortgage payment, property tax, insurance, maintenance, and utilities - end up incurring greater expenses which cause your cash flow to go out the expense column, not the income column
    - Even though most people receive a tax deduction for interest on mortgage payments, they pay for all their other expenses with after-tax dollars, even after they pay off their mortgage
    - Houses do not always go up in value
    - The greatest loss is from missed opportunities
        - Loss of time in which your assets could've grown in value
        - Loss of additional capital which you could have invested instead of paying for home maintenance
        - Loss of education which you could've gained investment experience to increase your assets
    - If you want a bigger house, think how you can get assets that will generate the money necessary to pay for the house
