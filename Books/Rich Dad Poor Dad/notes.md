### Introduction

- Being rich or poor is just a mindset
- Rich people think
    - How can I afford it
    - Taxes punish those who produce and reward those who don't produce
    - Study hard so you can find a good company to buy
    - Learn to manage risk
    - My house is a liability
    - Financial self-reliance
    - Write strong business and financial plans so you can create jobs
    - There is a difference between being poor and being broke. Broke is temporary. Poor is eternal
    - Money is power
- Poor people think
    - I can't afford it
    - The rich should pay more in taxes to help the less fortunate
    - Study hard so you can find a good company to work for
    - When it comes to money, play safe. Don't take risks.
    - Our home is our largest investment, and our greatest asset
    - I've worked hard for the government and I'm entitled to all these benefits
    - Write good resumes so I can find a good job
    - I'll never be rich
    - Money doesn't matter

> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I — I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference

- Financial education is more powerful than money
    - With it, you can always build wealth, even if you have no money

### Lesson 1: The Rich Don't work for Money

- The faster you can make a decision, the more likely you'll be able to seize opportunities
- Some people just let life push them. Others get angry and push back
- Most people want everyone else but themselves to change. But it's much easier to change yourself

> The poor and the middle class work for money. The rich have money work for them

- True learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire
- People's lives are controlled by money: the fear of the lack of money drives them to work hard to earny money but once they get the paycheck, greed or desire causes them to spend the money they just earned. This cycle perpetuates
- Be an observer, not a reactor to your emotions
    - When a person says, "I need to find a job", it's most likely an emotion doing the thinking. The fear of not having money generates that thought
    - Instead of waking up and going to work because of the fear of not paying your bills, ask yourself "Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?"
    - When emotions go up, intelligence goes down
- A job is really just a short term solution to a long term problem
- We're all employees ultimately. We just work at different levels
- What intensifies fear and desire is ignorance. Ignorance stems from your perception of money

### Lesson 2: Why Teach Financial Literacy?

- Intelligence solves problems and produces money. But money without financial intelligence is money soon gone
- It's not how much money you make. It's how much money you keep
- If you want to be rich, accounting will be your most important subject

> Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities that they think are assets

- An asset is something that puts money in your pocket whether you work or not
- A liability is something that takes money out of your pocket
- Most people have trouble with how they choose to spend the money they do have
    - If they would just look at their decisions in the mirror and ask themselves, "Does this make sense?"
    - If they would notice that they were just following the crowds

> An intelligent person hires people who are more intelligent than he is

- A house is not an asset. It's a liability
    - The additional expenses that go along with owning a house - mortgage payment, property tax, insurance, maintenance, and utilities - end up incurring greater expenses which cause your cash flow to go out the expense column, not the income column
    - Even though most people receive a tax deduction for interest on mortgage payments, they pay for all their other expenses with after-tax dollars, even after they pay off their mortgage
    - Houses do not always go up in value
    - The greatest loss is from missed opportunities
        - Loss of time in which your assets could've grown in value
        - Loss of additional capital which you could have invested instead of paying for home maintenance
        - Loss of education which you could've gained investment experience to increase your assets
    - If you want a bigger house, think how you can get assets that will generate the money necessary to pay for the house
- The middle class is always stuck in a self defeating loop because their salary is their primary source of income - when salaries increase, so do taxes

### Lesson 3: Mind Your Own Business

- One of the main reasons net worth isn't accurate is because once you begin selling your assets, they any gained are taxed
- Start acquiring real assets
    - Businesses that do not require any presence
    - Stocks
    - Bonds
    - Income generating real estate
    - Notes(IOUs)
    - Royalties from intellectual property such as music, scripts, and patents
    - Anything else that has value, produces income or appreciates, and has a ready market
- An important distinction is that the rich buy luxuries last while the poor and middle class buy luxuries first
    - The rich wait for their cash flows to support the spending of their luxuries

### Lesson 4: The History of Taxes and The Power of Corporations

- Governments use the tax laws to provide incentives to business owners and investors to create jobs and housing. As a result, this reduces taxes for the rich. In return, the government has to drive tax revenue from the middle class and the poor.
- A corporation is merely a legal document that creates a legal body without a soul
    - The income tax rate of a corporation is much less than that of an individual
    - Certain expenses can also be paid by a corporation using pre-tax dollars
- The rich search for ways to minimize their tax burden
    - Hire smart attorneys and accountants
    - Persuade politicians to change laws or create legal loopholes
    - For example, Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code allows a seller to delay paying taxes on a piece of real estate that is sold for a capital gain through an exchange for a more expensive piece of real estate

> If you work for money, you give the power to your employer. If money works for you, you keep the power and control it

- Financial IQ is made up of
    - Accounting
        - Financial literacy
            - The ability to read and understand financial statements which allow you to identify the strengths and weakness of any business
    - Investing
        - The science of "money making money"
        - Involves creative strategies and formulas
    - Understanding markets
        - Science of supply and demand
        - Knowing the technical aspects of the market which are emotion driven as well as the fundamental or economic aspects of an investment
    - The law
        - Corporation
            - Tax advantages
                - Pays expenses before paying taxes
                - Your vacations can be board meetings in Hawaii
                - Car payments, insurance, repairs, and health club membership can all be company expenses
                - Most restaurant meals can be partial expenses
                - All done legally with pre-tax dollars
            - Protection from lawsuits
                - When someone sues a wealthy individual, they are often met with lawyers and find that the wealthy person owns nothing, but controls everything
- Read
    - Garret Sutton's books on corporations have some good insight on the power of personal corporations

### Lesson 5: The Rich Invent Money

- Often in the real world, it's not the smart who get ahead but the bold
- Financial literacy matters in a world where information is wealth
    - Gives you the power of having more options by asking yourself what else you can do in your current position to improve upon your current financial status
- Our most powerful asset is our mind
- It is much better to buy assets with your money rather than save your money
    - When you save money, you're taxed on the interest
    - Asset money that is created isn't taxed
- There will be market booms and crashes
    - The person that has the greatest financial intelligence will be the one who gains from situations like these
- The greater your financial intelligence, the easier it is to tell if a deal is good
- The more you develop your financial intelligence, the more opportunities you will be offered

> Great opportunities are not seen with your eyes. They are seen with your mind

- Have fun while investing. Most people never win because they are too afraid of losing
- There are 2 kinds of investors
    - Those who buy  a packaged investment from a retail company
    - Those who create investments by assembling the deal themselves
        - Skills necessary
            - Finding opportunities that everyone else missed
            - Raising money
                - Those who say they can't raise money because of the bank or not having money are all wrong
                - You need to find ways to raise money and find loopholes in the system to buy certain things even if you don't have the money
            - Organize smart people
                - When you need advice, choose your advisor wisely
- There is always risk so you must learn to manage it than avoid it

### Lesson 6: Work to Learn — Don't Work for Money

- The popular opinion nowadays is to specialize in one thing but it's better to know a little about a lot and learn through osmosis
- Most people work hard to get a secure job, focusing on the pay and benefits in the short term
- What they need to do is seek work that will teach them the skills they'll need to be successful in the long term
    - Robert did this through first attending a school for international trade
    - Then he left when he knew he learned enough and found a job at Xerox, which has one of the best sales training programs in America
    - Then he left Xerox when he became one of the best in sales there to start his own company

> Job is an acronym for 'Just Over Broke'

- A management theory that does have a degree of truth is that "Workers work hard enough to not be fired, and owners pay just enough so that workers won't quit"
- Just as the rich are able to afford better education, they will also be able to keep themselves alive longer while those who have little wealth will die
- Take a second job to teach yourself a second skill
    - Join a network marketing company to learn sales skills
- The reason so many talented people are poor is because they focus too much on building a better product when they should be focusing on learn about business systems
    - The more specialized you become, the more trapped and dependent on that specialty
- The main management skills needed for success are
    - Management of cash flow
    - Management of systems
    - Management of people
- The rich give first, then receive

### Lesson 7: Overcoming Obstacles

- It's not having fear that is the problem. It's how you handle fear and losing
    - If you hate risk and worry, start early. If you start young, it's easier to be rich
    - For most people, the reason they don't win financially is because the pain of losing money far outweighs the joy of being rich
- Failure inspires winners. Failure defeats losers
    - After Pearl Harbor, America didn't wallow in defeat; America turned "Remember pearl harbor" into a nationwide rallying chant and America soon emerged as a world power
- All of us have doubts created in our own minds. It takes great courage to not let rumors and negative chatter affect your inner mind

> Cynics criticize. Winners analyze

- Most people stay busy to avoid something they don't want to face
    - The cure to laziness is to have a little greed.
    - Without a little greed, the desire to have something better, you can't progress

    > Do what you feel in your heart to be right—for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't

- Our lives are more a reflection of our habits than our education
    - Rich people have a habit of paying themselves first, then the government, even if they don't have enough money
    - The pressure to pay taxes and other creditors that comes from doing that forces them to seek other forms of income. This motivation is what makes them financially stronger, mentally and fiscally
- When you are ignorant on a subject, find yourself a mentor or book on that subject
    - It is what you don't know that loses you money so start learning

### Lesson 8: Getting Started

> There is gold everywhere. Most people are not trained to see it

- Find a reason greater than reality: the power of spirit
    - A reason is a combinations of "wants" and "don't wants"
    - Deep seated emotional wants
        - I want to be free to travel the world and live in the lifestyle I love
        - I want to be young when I do this
        - I want to be simply free
        - I want to control over my time and my life
        - I want money to work for me
- Make daily choices: the power of choice
    - Our spending habits reflect who we are
        - Spend less. Invest more
    - Rich people choose to be rich every day. Poor people choose to be poor every day
    - Invest first in education
        - If you learn something new, you are required to make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned
- Choose friends carefully: the power of association
    - If you get rich, you will notice that your friends who have no money will never come ask you how you got rich. But they will ask you about either a loan or job
    - Be true to yourself and be willing to not go with the crowd
        - Wise investors buy an investment before it's popular. Then they patiently wait
    - Insider trading
        - You want to have rich friends because they can provide you with the information about when and where money will be made
        - You want to know when the next boom happens. You want to get in quick and get out before it goes bust
- Master a formula and then learn a new one: the power of learning quickly
    - In today's ever changing world, it's how fast you learn, not how much you know
- Pay yourself first: the power of self discipline
    - Each month, allocate money to your asset column before paying your monthly expenses, even if it means going into a bit of debt
        - But of course make sure that those bills that are due are small ones
    - To do so successfully, keep these 2 rules in mind
        - Keep your expenses low. Build up assets. Then buy your luxury
        - When you come up short, let the pressure build up. Don't draw your savings to pay for your debt but instead call on your financial genius to think of ways to make extra money to pay off your debt
- Pay your brokers well: the power of good advice
