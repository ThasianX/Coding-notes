### Chapter 1: The beach bum and the millionaire

- Millionaire is just a metaphor for success: what you should really think about is not financial success but rather a million dollar smile, a million friends, millions of dollars worth of joy, love, contentment, fulfillment, passion
- The same activities that help us get from failure to survival are the same activities that can help us go from survival to success. We just have to keep doing them

### Chapter 2: The first ingredient

- Actions create result. This is a value driven approach, not an entitled approach of "Pay me more and I'll do more"
- Your philosophy is *what you know, how you hold what you know, and how it affects what you do*
- Successful people fail their way to the top. Do the thing and you shall have the power

> I have not failed. I've simply discovered ten thousand ways that don't work - Thomas Edison

- Philosophy → Attitudes → Actions → Results → Life

### Chapter 3: The choice

- A dying father offers his 2 children a choice: they can either have 1 million dollars or 1 penny. The boy who takes the million spends it without a care in the world and ends up losing it all. The other boy who takes the penny lets it keep growing every day and one day, the boy has a million dollars and counting.
  - This principle of compound interest is what Einstein calls the 8th wonder
- The slight edge is either working for you or against you. So stop waiting and start acting.
- It's never too late to start. It's always too late to wait.
- Have faith in the process of simple, positive actions repeated over time. The small things really do make a difference.
- Start thinking about your daily decisions and whether they align with your philosophy.

### Chapter 4: Master the mundane

> Yet the world was chock full of people exactly like this delightful shoeshine woman—people with their private hopes and dreams, and with all the marvelous personalities and attributes and inborn abilities they needed to realize those dreams, yet whose pathways forward failed to take them where they were hoping to go. People who already had so much going for them

- Measure success in every aspect of your life: vibrant health, plenty of good friends, people who are full of energy and curiosity, always learning new things and excited about life.
- Perseverance is a great substitute for talent.
- It is the steady, repeated action of water that can wear even the hardest rock down to a smooth surface
- A good rule in life: live below your means
  - Parkinson's law: "Work expands to fill the time time available for its completion". Financially, this means "Whatever I have, I spend that plus a little more". This is very true since we tend to overestimate how much time we need for something, in this case, money. If we gave ourselves less time for a task and treated things as a deadline, we would be working much smarter and faster
- Unsuccessful people choose the path of least resistance. Despite the actions needed for success being easy to do, most people won't since it's so easy to skip over them
- The factors that create success in the long term aren't apparent in the short term. Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal
- The actions that create success seem insignificant. Most people think that what they do right now doesn't matter, but it does. What you do now and every day matters.

### Chapter 5: Slow down to go fast

- The power of time is all you need to direct your life on the right path
- Time magnifies those small and seemingly insignificant things you do every day into something unstoppable in the future, either good or bad. Therefore, you can choose to have either good or bad habits, knowing what the final result will be compounded over time.
- The natural progression of life: you plant, cultivate, and harvest. But today, society is all about instant gratification; essentially, everyone wants to go from planting to harvesting. This is the reason why so many people give up before they can even see the results of their labor. Cultivating is all about doing actions persistently and daily and it can only happen over time.
- The slight is edge is boring. There is no immediate feedback. But over time, you will start to see results. It's a matter of knowing that results will happen and having faith in the process.
- Your everyday choices should be looked at through the eyes of time, not through the eyes of evidence. You won't be able to see results happening at first.

> Simply by making those right decisions, or making more of them — one at a time, over and over again — you will have enlisted the awesome power of the slight edge on your behalf. The unwanted circumstances, the poor results you've produced in the past, and the evidence of failures in your life, may all continue for a time. There may be no light at the end of the tunnel, or at least none you can see today. But by putting time on your side, you've marshaled the forces of the slight edge. Your success becomes invincible. You just need to stay in the process long enough to give it a chance to win. It starts with a choice

- Most people lived with one foot tucked tightly in the past and another timidly into the future, never fully present in the moment. The slight edge is all about being in the present: being aware of the choices you make, the people you talk to, the foods you eat,  the books you read, etc.
- Your philosophy is your view of how things are. A good philosophy would be "If I stay on this road long enough, I'll get the result I'm seeking". It's not about willpower, mood, or feelings. It's about knowing.

### Chapter 6: Don’t fall for the quantum leap

- Luck is preparedness created by doing simple positive small actions daily. It’s the constancy of preparedness that creates opportunity
- The quantum leap of jumping from planting to harvesting without cultivating is a myth
- Wilberforce and Abraham Lincoln spent much of their life failing before slavery laws were passed
- The myth of our culture is the giant step
- the flashes of recognition and overnight success people have are all results of a long and patient process

> You want a miracle, Bruce? Be the miracle

- No success is immediate. No collapse is sudden. They are all the results of the slight edge accruing momentum over time

### Chapter 7: The secret of happiness

- Happiness breeds success, not the other way around
- The way to get the slight edge to work for you is to incorporate happy habits along with it
- Happy habits are simple and easy actions you can do everyday, such as meditating, writing down things you are grateful for, sending a friend a positive message, etc

> Be happy and the reason will appear

### Chapter 8: The ripple effect

- A single committed person can make a huge change in the world
- Every day, we have a ripple effect on others, but it is our choice whether that is positive or negative
- With greater success comes greater responsibility to the world around us

> I want the world to be better because I was here. I want my life, my work, my family to mean something. If you are not making someone else’s life better you are wasting your time. Your life will only become better by helping make others lives better

### Chapter 9: But you have to start with a penny

> The journey of a thousand miles often starts with a single step

- Examples: Stephen King's success was propelled by a novel he finished only after his wife told him that she thought it was worth continuing after he threw it in the trash basket. Mark Zuckerberg originally made a website for people to rate each other by looks which turned into facebook. Rosa Parks was the catalyst for the new civil rights organization launched by MLK.
- Successful people do what unsuccessful people aren't willing to do: in this case, doing just 1 percent more every day

> A penny saved is a penny earned

- Greatness is always in the moment of the decision
- If you just add 1 percent of anything per day, in a year it will have more than tripled. But you have to start with the 1 percent.

### Chapter 10: Two Life Paths

> I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference

- Your life path is a journey: every moment of the day, curving up or down
- If you're not increasing in your journey, you're decreasing

> Life is a curved construction; time is its builder, and choice its master architect

- Most people in life will be yanking you down because if you succeed, it reinforces the fact that they are not where they want to be
- People on the failure curve have a state of blame. People on the success curve have a state of responsibility

> A man can fail many times but he isn't a failure until he begins to blame somebody else

- Successful people realize their own limitations are self-imposed. They realize that it isn't what happens to them that's important but how they respond to what happens that makes the difference between success and failure
- People on the success curve focus on the future, the macro vision, compounded by micro actions
- What's uncomfortable now becomes comfortable later
- Self assessment: these are the areas of your life you should be striving to make better
  - Your health
  - Your happiness
  - Your friendships
  - Your personal development
  - Your finances
  - Your career
  - Your positive impact on the world
- Success in one area breeds success in another

### Chapter 11: Mastering the slight edge

- Mastery is the state of mind that lies at the very beginning, not in reaching the end
- Having knowledge of what you want may feel uncomfortable but is essential towards winning
- You may have been in a situation where you've told your friends about your biggest ambitions and they end up just squirming instead of feeling excited. This is because you are showing them your want(desire), which makes them aware of their want(lack)
- Wanting is tangibly feeling your dreams tugging at your present circumstances
- The size of the problem determines the size of the person
  - People with huge and vivid dreams are pulled towards their dreams with such force
  - People who give up on their dreams are destined to stay mediocre
- Successful people embrace living uncomfortably in order to attain a life that is genuinely comfortable, not deceptively comfortable, as often the life of the masses are
- Find out what the majority are doing and do the opposite
- For whom do millions actually remember? For whom do millions actually mourn?
  - For those who will do what others are not willing to do.
  - It is for those who we erect statues.
  - Ripple effect and true mastery

### Chapter 12: Invest in yourself

- The best decision you can make in life is to invest in your own continuous development and learning
- All success is built from a foundation of study smarts plus street smarts
    - Life Confucius said, "Knowledge without practice is useless and practice without knowledge is dangerous"
- Life is doing. If you aren't doing, you're dying
- The more you learn, the more insight you get about what you experienced in your activity, and you're better able to re-approach the activity with new insight
- With the slight edge, you know that from point A to B, you'll be off track most of the time. But you know that it is the slight adjustments along the path that have the most power in your life
- There is no one more effective at undermining your success and nobody more effective at supporting your success than yourself
- The whole aim of self investment is not for accumulating skills but to train how you think and what you think
- How to program your subconscious
    - Start thinking about your intention with your conscious mind
    - Repeat it over and over until it is handed off to the subconscious

### Chapter 13: Learn from mentors

- Knowledge through modeling is the 3rd type of learning which will greatly help you consolidate your own insights
- When you find a worthy mentor who believes in you and you see what you can are capable of, then you start to believe more in yourself
- Choose your role models wisely. Are they really people who can help you and who you truly want to emulate?
- The law of association: you and your five closest friends will tend to have similar ideas, relationships, financial statuses, attitudes, etc in life
    - Therefore, your "associates" either take you up the success curve or drag you down the failure curve
    - One way to gauge this is through pondering about your conversations with them
        - Are they about responsibility, big dreams, and bold initiatives?
        - Are they future focused and dream building?
    - There are definitely people you are only spending a few minutes with every day with who you should be spending much more time with and vice versa
    - You should disassociate yourself with people who don't empower you
        - Casual friendships deserve casual time
        - This requires compassionate awareness
    - Form a mastermind
        - In "Think and grow rich", Napoleon Hill talks about the mastermind, a group of people with like minds and different talents all with the purpose of serving the goals of every member of the group.

> Using those three dimensions of learning—study, do, model—with slight edge persistence, in time your level of mastery rises to the point where you turn around and realize others are modeling you. You have yourself become worthy of emulating, of serving as a guide and hero to others. The cream has become butter; the hyacinth of knowledge has covered the pond of your effort. You have grown into leadership—and now you're the mentor.

### Chapter 14: Use your slight edge allies

> Be not afraid of going slowly; be afraid only of standing still

- Momentum
    - The tortoise vs hare fable demonstrates this well
        - The key phrase is "slow but steady" and the key word is "steady" because steady actions create momentum
    - Going too fast often puts one's system's survival at risk
    - Find your own optimal speed of growth
    - Do daily activities that boost your momentum as they will help you keep yourself on track once you've started

    > Give yourself something to work toward—constantly

- Completion
    - Each incomplete thing in your life sucks away from your energy of accomplishment
    - Incomplete things drag you to the past
        - Successful people are pulled by the future
    - Take on incomplete tasks one at a time
- Reflection
    - Doing things won't create success; doing things right will
    - Questions to ask
        - Did you take a step forward?
        - Did you listen to good information today, or just tune into music?
        - Did you engage in positive conversation or just gossip?
        - Did you do what unsuccessful people aren't willing to do?
    - Keep your progress, or the lack of it, right in your face
    - A powerful exercise
        - At the end of each day, write down what you did that day
        - Then ask yourself these questions
            - In each area of my life, what are the critical, simple little things that are easy to do, and easy not to do?
            - Did I do them?
            - Did I move forward?
            - Did I ride the success curve?
- Celebration
    - Notice slight edge activities you accomplish and feel good about them
    - Trust the process and when you notice it's going well, celebrate

### Chapter 15: Cultivate slight edge habits

- Every one of your habits - good or bad - have their roots in choice, until they become automatic and take a life of their own
- Your activities are the results of your choices in the present moment
- The best way to get rid of unwanted habits are to replace them with a habit you do want
- Power slight edge habits
    - Show up
        - Be the frog who not only decides to jump off but actually jumps

        > Do the thing and you shall have the power

        - By just committing to showing up, you have already won half the battle

        > Hope begins in the dark, the stubborn hope that if you just show up and try to do the right thing, the dawn will come. You wait and watch and work: you don't give up.

    - Be consistent
        - Show up consistently
    - Have a positive outlook
        - Approaching the events of life with a positive outlook helps move you toward your goals
        - Notice other people's better qualities and look past their weaker ones
        - But cultivating a positive outlook doesn't mean you can't get depressed
            - Depression hits everyone at random times
            - The first thing you want to do is go through your list of blessings, things you're thankful for
            - Embrace the hard and difficult times because you know it will make you stronger
    - Be committed for the long run

        > It takes a long time to grow an old friend

        - Ask yourself, are you willing to put in 10,000 hours to get what you want?
    - Cultivate a burning desire backed by faith
        - The kind of faith that keeps you up late at night and gets you up early in the morning
        - The ones who achieve great things not only passionately want to achieve their dreams but also see themselves achieving them
            - They deeply and passionately want to get somewhere and they know - not hope or wish - that they are going to get there
    - Be willing to pay the price
        - Whatever price you pay, there's a bigger price to pay for not doing it than the price for doing it
            - Success may take you 5 to 10 years to achieve but failure will take a you a lifetime
    - Practice slight edge integrity
        - This is what you do when no one is watching
        - Do you hold yourself accountable to what you said you were going to do?

### Chapter 16: Three steps to your dreams

- Step one: Write it down
    - This helps with envisioning your dream
        - Envisioning is simply creating a vivid picture of something that hasn't factually happened yet and to make that picture so vivid that it feels real
    - My goals - what and when
        - I would love to have multiple vacation houses all the over the world when I travel. A house in China, London, Italy, California, Hawaii, Canada, Japan, and Korea. I want to have these houses by the time I'm 30 years old.
        - I would love to marry a beautiful wife who's also passionate about success. Someone who is understanding about the sacrifices I would have to make in terms of relationship time. Someone who will empower me in my work and outside my work. I want to find the perfect wife by the time I'm 35 years old.
        - I would love to become the biggest and baddest CEO of a technology company that innovates the future, making virtual reality chips to download human consciousness and designs space shuttles that allow for intergalactic exploration. I want to become a successful CEO by the time I'm 25.
        - I would love to be the richest person in the world. So much money, even richer than the current Jeff Bezos, that I can virtually control countries and governments. My money would be spent towards catalyzing human civilization in our inevitable transition towards sustainable energy, intergalactic exploration, virtual reality, and augmented reality. I want this to happen by the time I'm 25.
        - I would love to have radiant health even as I grow older. I would engage in lifting consistently and feel pumped and energetic afterwards. I want my strength to keep progressing, going against what people think as people get older. I want this to happen from now all the way until the day I die.
- Step two: Look at it everyday
    - Helps to counteract the force of mediocrity
    - Utilizes the power of the subconscious mind
    - Surround yourself with your own yesses
    - Know that your own dreams are inevitable
- Step three: Start with a plan
    - The point of a plan is not to get you there but to help you get started
        - It is your jumping off point

    > Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal

    - Keep holding onto this philosophy, which will help you generate the attitudes and actions needed to keep progressively realizing a better plan

> Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it

- Don't try to figure out the whole race. Just take that bold step onto the path of mastery. The result looks incredibly complex and intimidating but it's not
- Personal story tips
    - Change your language from "can't, maybe, don't know" to "can, sure, I will figure it out"
    - When faced with disappointment and failure, ask yourself, "What did you learn?"
