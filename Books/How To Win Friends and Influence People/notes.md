### Part One : Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

### Chapter 1: “If you want to gather honey, don’t kick over the beehive”

- Examples of notorious villains not repenting or apologizing for their actions, but justifying that they were in the right and everyone else wrong. This is significant because if villains don’t see their own actions as wrong, then the question is do ordinary people see things the same way. This turns out to be true as shown by a case study where a manager didn’t condemn workers for not wearing their helmets and instead tried to understand why they didn’t wear the helmets and remind them that helmets are there to protect them. This act of understanding caused greater amounts of workers to wear the helmet
- So as can be seen, people only care about themselves and how they can justify their actions. Therefore, to become better at dealing with people, you want to not condemn others for their actions but seek to understand why they did a wrong action.
- In the case that you are being condemned, don’t immediately seek to justify yourself but seek to understand why the accusers think what they think. This way, you can learn some things that you might’ve been doing wrong and it shows you are a very likable individual.
- Another example is where the father constantly scolds the child despite feeling regret and remorse inside for doing so. But one day, the child timidly walks into the fathers study room. The father immediately gets impatient and asks “what do you want”. The child jumps into the fathers arms and kisses and quickly runs away. It is here that the father has an epiphany about the awful feelings he has whenever he scolds his child and he vows to never do so again
- The last example is the pilot one where a pilot stops flying because he notices something off about his plane. His intuition is correct and the person who fueled his plane put jet fuel instead of plane fuel. He of course is angry and goes to the plane station the next day to confront the fueler. But contrary to how most individuals would respond to the situation, angry at the fact that this mistake could’ve cost a few lives, the pilot goes up to the nervous fueler and pats him on the back and says: “look, I know you won’t make a mistake like this next time so tomorrow, why don’t you install my plane fuel?”
- Principle: don’t condemn, criticize, or complain

### Chapter 2: The big secret of dealing with people

- Examples of how bad and good people both desire feelings of importance. Rockefeller got this feeling through helping poor people he never met. Gang members get this feeling through newspaper featuring them.
- Of course, there’s flattery and appreciation. Flattery is insincere and easy to spot because you’re not really present and just seeking to embellish. Appreciation is sincere and universally accepted and it comes from your heart because of small things you notice about them
- Example: a blind man(Stevie wonder) was asked to find a rat in a room since hem was gifted with innate superior hearing. The person who asked him offered sincere appreciation for his help and his ability to hear so well. This appreciation was a spark of inspiration that led him to pursue a legendary music career
- Example: rockefeller’s friend started a venture which failed and lost a million dollars. Instead of criticizing him or mentioning the massive loss, Rockefeller told his friend to look on the bright side: he retained 60% of what he lost which is pretty good considering rockefellers own failed ventures
- Example: A janitor is often mocked for doing his job poorly. But one day when he does a good job, his superior tells him how good he did that day. Following that, as he starts doing better work, he gets more appreciation from others
- Principle: give honest sincere appreciation

### Chapter 3: He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walls a lonely path.

- To persuade others, you first have to put yourself in their perspective, their shoes. You want to talk about what they want, how it will benefit them, rather than what you want.
- You want to make them feel important: less in approbation and more in lavish praise
- Example: author’s rent about to increase but he talks to the manager and details how by not increasing his rent, more and more people will come for his lectures, which is good for the hotel. This effectively causes the manager to change his mind without losing any of his pride since the author only talked about how it would benefit the hotel.
- Example: Rockefeller bet that he could make the sons of a mother respond to his mail. Before this, the sons had pretty much forgotten about their ill mother and didn’t respond to her letters since it didn’t trigger any desire of theirs. Rockefeller recognized something the boys wanted, money, and appealed to this desire through sending a letter saying he would attach 5$ for each of them. In reality, he purposely didn’t attach the money to solicit out a response from them. A few days later, the boys did respond, thanking Rockefeller for his kind letter but also mentioning how he didn’t attach the money, something they clearly want
- Example: appealing to companies can be quite difficult but one of the people part of the program in this book actually got 11 of 12 companies to give her offers. She did this through writing a letter to them stating how her skills could be of benefit to the company and not talking anything about what she wants.
- Another thing is self expression, shown by an example of a kid who refuses to eat cereal for breakfast. The parents responded through letting the child make the cereal that morning and that form of self expression actually triggered an impulse to eat cereal. So self expression is quite powerful in persuasion as getting the person to invest in something makes them more likely to listen
- Example: a kid doesn’t want to go to kindergarten. The parents think of what the child would want and end up playing a fun game that kindergarten kids would play. The kid comes down and sees how fun the game is and asks to join. He is refused since he doesn’t know how to play the game and the only way to learn is through kindergarten. The next morning, the kid wakes up earlier than his dad and says that he is excited to go to kindergarten
- Principle: arouse in the other person an eager want

### Part Two : Six Ways to Make People Like You

### Chapter 1: Do this and you’ll be welcome everywhere

- Theodore Roosevelt was very well known by his valet and servants. He would memorize the names of every one of them and remember certain things about them. Even if he didn’t see them, he would call out their names as he passed by their quarters
- Remembering the birthdays of other people is a great way to show genuine interest. To do this, ask whether they believe the month of birthday is associated with disposition. Then get the birthday
- Example: an old man who wants to learn the fiddle begins his journey by asking well known fiddlers in his neighborhood about the fiddle. By doing so, he shows interest in their work and makes many friends
- Example: oil company wants to sell oil but a chain company is monopolizing the fuel that is being bought. To better understand why this is happening, the boss simulated a debate and takes the negative(arguing against the affirmative-chain companies are bad). To do this, he visits a chain company and asks to speak to the manager to discuss a few points about why chain companies are good. This debate sparks interest in the manager who talks for an hour about why his chain company is doing a good service to the world. The boss is shown a warm exit and asked to visit again after the debate and is offered to get his fuel bought. This shows how by not talking about his fuel and being interested in the chain company’s oil, the boss was able to learn a new perspective and gain his goal without asking for it.
- Principle: become genuinely interested in other people

### Chapter 2: A simple way to make a good first impression

- Example: greeting coworkers with a smile and “how are you” tends to leave a good first impression
- Example: a man smiled to at least 5 people a day to see its effects. It changed his stale relationship with his wife and improved the quality of his life as he smiled to the people on the elevator and at work. People noticed the changes immediately and said how they now felt like he was likable.
- Actions can influence the will(it is commonly understood the will begets action). So just acting cheerful can induce happiness
- There is also the philosophy that there is nothing good or bad but it is people who see them as good or bad. So if you don’t categorize things, then you won’t see things like that. The stoic philosophy
- Example: managers who hire applicants usually are cold on the phone. This one applicant was offered multiple places to work but chose one on the lower end and when asked why by the smily manager, the applicant said that it was because the manager was the warmest
- Principle: smile

### Chapter 3: If you don’t do this, you’re headed for trouble

- Andrew Carnegie was well known for remembering the names of his workers and those he worked with. He would go to great lengths to remember their names, fixing the person’s attribute to their name. In one instance, he was able to strike a deal with an opposing railway company through naming the combined company that they planned to make the name of the other company’s owner. Naming things based on the names of others is a great way to develop friendship
- Roosevelt also remembered names, a key to his success. If he didn’t hear their name clearly, he would ask them to repeat it. If it was a hard to say name, he would ask how to spell it.
- Saying hard names that others would normally abbreviate is a good way to develop rapport
- Even old figures like Napoleon made it a need to remember names of those he met. In isolation, he would write the name on a piece of paper and fix it firmly in his mind
- Principle: remember that to a person their name is the sweetest and most important sound in any language

### Chapter 4: An easy way to become a good conversationalist

- Being a good listener is key to mastering the art of conversation
- You don’t even have to talk. Just get the other person to invest by asking questions about things they are passionate about
- Example: a 14 year old kid was interested in great figures so he read an autobiography of those people. After, he mailed them asking questions about their childhood and if it was really true. These famous figures actually mailed back and the kid was invited to some dinners and treated as a welcome guest to many of their houses.
- Example: dealing with angry customers can be quite difficult. To deal with them effectively, this manager actually sat down with the customer and listened to the customer as he complained and rambled about his problems. The manager sympathized and agreed with his points. Actually listening to the grievances of others is one way to develop a good friendship
- Don’t be a person who interrupts people while they are giving their story or doesn’t listen to what the other person is saying
- Other people are inherently more interested in their problems and wants than your problems and wants
- Principle: be a good listener, encourage them to talk about themselves

### Chapter 5: How to interest other people

- Roosevelt took the time to actually learn about other peoples interest
- Talking about that 1000000 dollar check and how it came to be is good
- The secretary story: a man wanted to get close to a wealthy businessman for a job. However, that businessman was very reclusive towards job applicants. First, the man found out what interested the businessman through talking with people who knew him: power and money. Second, he met with the businessman’s secretary to discuss how he would help the man earn money. The secretary, enticed, scheduled an appointment with the man and that was very successful as he talked about how he would help the businessman achieve what he wanted. This would have never happened if not for him knowing what the businessman really wanted
- Principle: talk in terms of the other person’s interest

### Chapter 6: How to make other people like you instantly

- Jesus said it many years ago: do onto others how you would wants others to do onto you
- Example: a person was very interested in a famous figure. He wrote a book about that famous figure and his admiration for that figure. This caught the attention of the figure and the person was invited to the house
- Example: Sincerely compliment a person’s valuables. In a story, a person complimented the house of an old man and how nice it looked. The old man said how nowadays, young men don’t appreciate the beauty of houses and he went on talking for an hour. Then, he gifted the person with some chairs.
- Example: Teacher moves a shy and quiet student into an advanced class. When the student cries and questions if he’s good enough, the teacher responds yes.
- Example: Sincerely telling a person that you really need them can revoke a resignation letter. This is what happened when a boss realized that a key worker of his was going to resign due to his lack of skills in treating her. He sincerely professed how he really needed her in the company and apologized and invited her to a meal
- Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
- Principle: Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely

### Part 3: how to win people to your way of thinking

### Chapter 1: You can’t win an argument

- Example: our narrator was once a very argumentative person who was enrolled in debate classes. This caused him to always be defensive towards his positions. One night at a dinner, he got into a scuffle with a person who said a quote was from a bible when it really wasn’t. The best way to resolve this is not to point it out but just say, “Yes. That is from the Bible”. The man didn’t ask for you to appoint yourself as an arbiter of correctness nor do you need the sense of self importance gained from it.
- The best way under high heaven to win an argument is to avoid it. Nothing good ever comes out of an argument. Even if you win an argument, you still lose. Choose between an academic victory or the goodwill of your opponent. If you want the latter, then don’t argue
- Welcome the disagreement. Distrust your natural reaction. Listen closely and try to pinpoint areas of agreement to talk about. Express that you really do care about his thoughts. Thank him for having the same interests as you.
- When one person yells, the other should listen. There is no communication when two people are yelling, just noise and bad vibration.
- Principle: the only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it

### Chapter 2: a sure way of making enemies- and how to avoid it

- Diplomacy is key to this. The self control needed to actually not point out a person is wrong and hurt his or her ego but to carefully speak with tact. If you think someone is wrong, say “well look. I may be wrong and I often am wrong when it comes to matters like this but I think that...” this gives the other person room to admit error since you’re being so kind and generous in your approach
- A lot of the time, we never really understand what the other person says. We listen and form evaluations(nice, bad) about the other person’s statements. What we should actually do is seek to understand what the statement really means to the other person. We’re so quick to point out their errors without understanding why they made it in the first place. For the draperies example, a friend of the narrator came over to look at the new drapery. The price was mentioned and he spoke the hard truth: the drapery wasn’t worth the amount of money spent. This causes the narrator to defend himself. The next day another friend comes over who admires it and says that he wishes he could also afford such an exquisite drapery. The narrator’s attitude completely changes as he admits to his error of paying too much to buy it
- Ben Franklin mastered the art of talking to people which can be seen in his legendary biography. He used to be a very know it all person who made sure to set all the facts straight as he talked with people. This made him unlikable and one of his friends told him this one day and he accepted this truth graciously. He resolved to change himself and forbid himself from using dogmatic phrases like “I’m certain” and making sure to always talk with tact: “I conceive, I imagine, it might be like this”. He found that this made a world of a difference as he talked with people and conversations sailed more smoothly.
- Other notable people like a high positioned general in the military showed signs of knowing this as well. When asked who he admired most, he mentioned one of the officers below him. This surprised the asked as the officer was the most rebellious person on his squad who hated the general. The general responded that you asked me what I felt of him, not what he felt of me.
- Examples of diplomacy: a dealership sends an agent out to figure out some complaints. The agent doesn’t immediately point out the buyer is wrong in is evaluation but hears the buyer out and asks questions on what he thinks is wrong about their material. The agent leads the buyer to the conclusion that he is wrong and the buyer asks the agent on his thoughts. This ends resolved.

### Insights from the rest of the book

- Principle: show respect for the other person’s opinion, never say you’re wrong
- If you’re wrong, admit it
- Beat the other person to it and blaming yourself will often lead to goodwill
- Begin in a friendly way when talking to people. This holds especially true if you have an issue you want resolved from that person. Lincoln said “a drop of honey attracts more flies than a gallon of gall”. Friendliness sets up a good mood in which the other person is willing to help you out.
- Get the other person saying yes yes immediately. Keep getting admission after admission through talking more on areas you agree on. Ask questions in which they have no choice but to agree
- Let the other person do the great deal of talking. Let them excel you: that way they feel important. They would much rather talk about their achievements rather than hear your own. Only talk about yourself when they ask
- Let the other person feel that the idea you are trying to express is his or her’s idea. Instead of selling something to them, let them sell themselves to it. You can do this by asking for their input on the matter and calibrating to their desires.
- Try honestly to see things from the other person’s POV. Just mastering this alone can be a huge stepping stone in my career. This will help me make less enemies and understand others better as their actions always have some kind of meaning behind them.
- Be sympathetic to the other person’s ideas and desires. Everyone just wants someone who can understand them and they crave this sympathy. This goes in tandem with seeing things from the other person’s POV and will definitely improve my character. I can say phrases like “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel as you do.” Sympathize with people who are often hot headed and say “There but for the grace of God go I”
- Appeal to the nobler motives like mothers(my mother doesn’t want that) or the other person’s dignity. Make them in charge of the thing at hand and make sure they feel content with it
- Dramatize your ideas. That is one way to get someone to do something you want them to do
- Throw down a challenge. People love a good challenge that’s related to their work so they can have a chance for self expression and self worth.
- When you need to find fault, make sure to start with praise and honest appreciation. This way, when you give the unpleasant words, they won’t find it as unpleasant after hearing pleasant words.
- Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly. Also, never use the word “but” after saying words of praise. This will seem like a manipulative way to get someone to do something. Instead, use “and” so it sounds like a continuation of the praise
- Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. By admitting a mistake yourself, it makes it easier for the other person to admit theirs.
- Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. People don’t like being ordered which makes suggesting something to do a much more comfortable choice.
- Let the other person save face.
- Praise the slightest improvement and every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise. When praising, make sure it’s specific so it comes off as sincere. Encouraging others like this will help them realize their latent potential and spur them to success
- Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Even if they don’t have those traits, still give the traits to them. This way, they’ll feel the need to perform as if they had those traits
