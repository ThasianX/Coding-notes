# Ping Texts

- Once a girl's replied to your initial message, then it's important not to jump straight into a date request, as that gives off a needy, desperate vibe which broadcasts to the girl that you're not a busy guy.
- In between getting her number and asking her out on a date, then you need to send her  “ping” texts to bridge the gap and keep you on her mind, without sucking her energy through an endless stream of questions and requests.
- Ping texts should be statements, telling her things about what you're up to.
- Make sure it's a fun statement. Because if it is, she'll reply anyway, without you having to ask her a question
- Your texts should be shorter than hers
- Don't ask any standard questions she asks - ie "How are you?"
- Don't reply straight away
- Be unpredictable when you answer
