## Meditations

### Books 1-4

- Be honest. Don’t lie. This will help me improve my character and integrity
- Be the same in all circumstances. Pain, victory, fame. Only the logos matters. This will help me develop greater strength and flexibility
- Don’t constantly correct people. Just answer their question or add another example. This will help me develop more friendships since people don’t like to admit they’re wrong.
- Optimism in adversity. This will help when cold approaching as I know that even if I do get rejected, I know I have still brightened the girl’s day
- Do a job without whining. This will help me develop that mental fortitude and acceptance that this is just the way of events. Since complaining isn’t going to help, why not just make the most out of it
- Having a sense of when to push and when to back off. This will help mainly in day game as I want to be pulling in the beginning and then recognizing that point where she’s hooked and then pushing and closing
- Handling material comforts. If they are there, I will take advantage of them. If not, I won’t miss them. This will help me keep my mind on the right track and not caught up in the superficial.
- Just start doing what needs doing and not the credit gained from doing it. This will really orient me in the right track for a good character

### Book 4

- When something unfortunate happens to you, reverse your thought immediately and think, this is fortunate that it happened to me and not someone else. It could’ve happened to anyone but not anyone would’ve remained unharmed by it. To endure misfortune is great fortune
- On death, think of all the people who have died toiling away from their lives, dying so old. Our life is so short. 3 days or 3 generations? There is no difference. So live your life. Live in the present

### Book 5

- Practice virtues you can show: one I need to practice is moderation.
- Do what needs doing
- Things that happen to us are ordered. It furthers our destiny. Accept what happens to you because it leads to the common good: nature would never bring something that wasn’t beneficial to the whole.
- Embrace the moments in life where you don't look so great. Every action of yours doesn't have to be cool, wise: after all, you're just human and imperfect but embrace the pursuit that you've embarked on
- In life, the people around you may be hard to put up with. But that's fine. Take refuge in yourself, knowing that all things that happen to you are natural and that you have the choice to not do things you don't want to.
- Being with other people is one of our daily occupations. Sometimes, they will impede us. But that is fine. "The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."
- If it doesn't harm the greater community, then it cannot harm you.

> Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone-those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the "what" is in constant flux, the "why" has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what's right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us-a chasm whose depths we cannot see. So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.

- When other people hurt you, it's their character that suffers, not yours.
- 2 characteristics shared between men and god: to not let anyone hold you back and to locate the goodness in thinking and doing the right things
- good fortune is not given but created: good character, good intentions and good actions

### Book 6

- Focus on the state of your own mind, the mind that avoids selfishness and works with others to achieve goals.
- just focus on what you need to do and You won’t be tempted by anything else. Jealousy is only going to lead you to your end. Prizing your own mind is the best path
- The only rewards of our life are a virtuous character and unselfish acts
- Focus on the source of where all things come from
- We often label certain outcomes and actions as good or bad and tend to blame others for them. But what if we just limited our perception of good and bad as our own actions? Then you would have no one to blame but yourself
- whatever happens to a single person is for the good of others
- To live our lives out truthfully and rightly and to have patience with others who don’t
- when we need encouragement, we should look to the qualities of people around us possess and how we can achieve those same virtues
- Our efforts are really subject to circumstances and we need a proper gauge of what counts as a success: to try. To try is to succeed.

> Ambition means tying your well-being to what other people say or do. Self-indulgence means tying it to the things that just happen to you. Sanity means tying it to your own actions.

- Practice hearing what people are really trying to say

### Book 7

- Our worth is measured by what we devote our energy and time to
- To not just act a certain way but to be a certain way. We have the power within to be virtuous and we don’t need to behave straightened, unlike our actual selves
- Something can only hurt you if you choose to interpret it as harmful
- Perceptions are harmful. See things for what they really are. Don’t judge
- the ability to recognize that people do bad things or make mistakes because they’re human. Accepting that and understanding they haven’t really hurt you is powerful
- when someone hurts you, have sympathy for them because they have only hurt themselves

> Discard your misperceptions. Stop being jerked like a puppet. Limit yourself to the present. Understand what happens - to you, to others. Analyze what exists, break it all down: material and causes. Anticipate your final hours. Other people’s mistakes? Leave it to their makers.

> To labor cheerfully and so endure the wind that blows from heaven

- Let your actions be not influenced by others and only by nature. All things were made for a higher being. Resist your body’s urges. Avoid rashness and think.
- Resolve to live up to your own expectations
- when you experience pain, one thing that can help is thinking about the limits of the pain and not magnifying them based on physical sensations. Another thing you can do is to remind yourself that “I’m giving into pain”
- don’t expect things in exchange for kindness

### Book 8

- Think in first principles - good and evil. Good being what leads to fairness, and self control and virtuous qualities.
- know the what, why and how for yourself
- you weren’t born for pleasure
- You have the option to do something today yet you choose to leave it for tomorrow.
- 3 relationships: one with yourself, one with god, and one with people
- assemble your life, action by action.
- to accept without arrogance and to let go with indifference
- Any rational being can take a setback and make it into a learning experience
- Pleasure is different for everyone: keeping your mind clear, not shying away from people and things you should be doing, and accepting everything that comes your way
- Stop living for your posthumous moments. Live in the present. Why should you care about what people say or think about you many years later
- Stick with first impressions. Don’t extrapolate. So if someone’s just insulted you, you just notice that you’ve been insulted but it hasn’t harmed you
- patience, humility, and honesty. The three qualities you need to win freedom
- Do you really want the praise of people who kick themselves nearly every twenty minutes, people who despise themselves and what they do?
- You have two choices with people: either instruct them or endure them. The former is always a win as you never know what might happen

### Book 9

- To do harm to someone else is to do harm to yourself
- Objective judgement, unselfish action, and willing acceptance of the events that occur in life
- anxiety is just a perception. You can easily discard it
- Not being done to but doing
- let other people fix their own mistakes
- throughout life, we all transform: childhood, youth, adulthood, old age. The end of each stage is a death and the beginning of the next is a new beginning. Think of death not as an end but as a transformation.
- Remind yourself of your own goals and beliefs. Remind yourself of the world and what you’re part of.
- when faced with insults from someone, try to understand why he’s doing what he’s doing, and wish him well because he’s the same being as you
- Go do what nature demands of you and don’t expect anything in return
- indifference to external actions and a commitment to justice in your own actions, meaning that they result in the greater good
- enough whining. The purpose of your life is clear
- Start changing the way you pray to god. Stop praying for things to happen and start praying to not feel fear, desire, and grief.
- Concentrate on what you’re doing. Don’t let your mind be influenced by external feelings
- why be surprised if someone is untrustworthy or a certain way? Don’t call other people ungrateful when it’s you who should’ve noticed that they didn’t deserve your trust in the first place. You were given logos for a reason: to see things as they are. And when helping others and not getting a reward in return, isn’t it enough that you did your duty as a human? Your eyes and feet don’t expect rewards for what they do and you shouldn’t either when you help others.

### Book 10

- Stop complaining and be satisfied with what you have in the present. Accept that all things are good and everything is the gift of gods.
- you can endure anything if it is of your mind’s interest to do so.
- everything that’s happened to you was destined
- nothing that benefits the whole can harm the parts. Think of yourself as a part of the whole you form. Then you’ll come to accept everything that happens to you. Then you’ll start acting in ways that benefit the whole, unselfishness, cooperative actions.
- epithets for yourself: modest. Upright. Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. Disinterest, as in not interested in fame, money, superficial things
- Ask yourself these 2 questions: are what you are doing now the right thing? Do you accept and welcome what you’ve been assigned?
- Does it make any difference if other people blame you for doing what’s right?
- Stop preaching about what the good man should be like and start being one
- every one of us needs what nature gives us, when nature gives it to us. Be patient in the meantime
- To see daily forces at work when they create sensations as we eat and work and procreate
- When faced with people’s bad behavior, think of times when you were also like that. Let your anger subside as you realize that they were acting under compulsion just as you were
- enjoyment is doing more of what nature requires of you. Using your logos more to keep your eyes fixed on the right path
- we are but mere leaves blown by the wind. None of us have much time left and yet we think we do
- a healthy mind a should be prepared for anything. Be prepared for haters, lovers, surprises, as that will help you increase your mental fortitude
- start asking “why” to everything, starting with your own actions

### Book 11

- The rational mind analyzes everything in life and then becomes indifferent. Indifference to pretty singing, dancing, martial arts, etc
- Stay focused on doing things for the common good.
- People will stop you as you do what is right for the whole and that's fine. Have some tolerance. Don't feel anger: anger is a sign of weakness.
- Other people's perceptions and actions toward you are their own problem. You just have to remain the same - still nice and patient, seeking to correct their wrongs.
- Keep in mind the parts and whole.We can choose to make perceptions about them and choose not to. Macro vision, micro actions
- You never know for sure that what the other person said is a mistake. Keep in mind how much you don't know
- It's not so much what others say or do to us but our own misperceptions of them. Discard your perceptions. Realize you've suffered no disgrace
- to expect bad people to not do bad things is just ignorance. And to expect them to exempt you from their bad acts is arrogant of you
- for every thought, ask if the thought is unnecessary, a product of the thinking around you, or destructive to the people around you
- To complain, feel anger, indulge, or feel fear are all actions that go against nature. You were created to show reverence for the divine and that means accepting all that happens as nature's command
- Your goal should be a common one and all your energy should be devoted towards that. In turn, your actions will too as well as you
- As a host, give your guests the very best and yourself what's left
- Steer clear of any desire and try to moderate your impulses, making sure they benefit others

### Book 12

- Let go of the past, leave the future to fate, and entrust the present to the gods and the truth
- Cut your mind free from impressions that cling to the mind and start concentrating on what can be lived
- We value other people's opinion about us more than our own. It shouldn't be like that.
- To see things as they are: substance, cause, and purpose
- It's all in how you perceive things. You are in control
- Keep in mind: that your actions are not arbitrary and with purpose, that things happen because of fate and you can't complain, that all things return to where they came from, and that feeling arrogant is pointless
- don't boast about your humility. Do the things you were born to do - uprightness, self control, obedience to god - without making a scene out of it



## Deep Work

### The Benefits

### Chapter 1: Deep work is valuable

- 3 groups of people that will succeed: high skilled workers, superstars, and owners
- Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy: the ability to quickly master hard things and the ability to produce at an elite level - quality and speed wise
- If you don’t produce, you won’t thrive. To be an elite, you have to transform that latent potential into tangible results that people value
- These 2 core abilities depend on your ability to perform deep work
- Deliberate practice: your attention has to be focused on a certain skill you’re trying to improve or idea you’re trying to master and you have to receive feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive
- By having this focused attention, you develop more myelin around relevant neurons, the physical mechanism that drives improvements on hard tasks. Diffused attention through working while distracted fires off too many circuits simultaneously which makes it hard to isolate the group of neurons you want to strengthen
- High quality work produced=(Time spent) * (Intensity of focus)
- Attention residue: a residue of your attention that remains stuck thinking about the original task
- Deep work minimizes the negative effects of attention residue

### Chapter 2: Deep work is rare

- The present day trends like instant messaging are undercutting deep work - actively decreasing one’s ability to go deep
- As knowledge work makes more complex demands of the labor force, it becomes harder to measure the value of an individual’s efforts
- The metric black hole: an opaque region resistant to measurements related to deep work. The metric black hole prevents the realization that distraction based behaviors are hurting one’s ability to work productively and allows the shift toward distraction we increasingly encounter in the professional world
- Principle of least resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment
- Basically, it’s easier. The quick responsiveness to your needs makes it easier. The culture of connectivity creates an environment where it becomes acceptable to run your day out of your inbox, making your life easier. Planning is too hard. Waiting is too hard.
- Busyness as a proxy for productivity: In the absence of clear indicator of what it means to be productive and valuable in their jobs, many knowledge workers turn back toward an industrial indicator of productivity: doing lots of stuff in a visible manner(emails, scheduling meetings, etc).
- The cult of the internet: a culture of technopoly leads to a seductive ideology that if a behavior relates to the internet, then it must be good. The disadvantage of this way of thinking is that it directly undermines core values of deep work like quality, craftsmanship, and mastery.
- All these trends are enabled by the difficulty of directly measuring the value of depth or the cost of ignoring it

### Chapter 3: Deep work is meaningful

- In the past, there was a very clear connection between deep work and a good life, as portrayed by a master craftsman. But in today’s society, this connection is very unclear. One reason is because of how much harder it is to define exactly how one knowledge worker’s work differs from another as their work consists mostly of emails and powerpoint. Another reason for this lack of clarity is that there are just a cacophony of voices telling workers to spend more time in shallow activities like social media, email, and instant messaging. But just because it’s hard to define the connection between depth and meaning in today’s society, it doesn’t mean you can’t. There are 3 arguments for why a deep life is one that is not just economically lucrative but also a life well lived.
- Neurological perspective: too often, we are focused on the circumstances that shape us in life. We don't really pay attention to the small accomplishments but we put more emphasis on the bigger ones like getting a bigger house or getting diagnosed with cancer. This is a life that is destined to lead to unhappiness as you will always be accepting stimuli from everywhere, positive or negative. But by focusing your attention selectively, you can tune out negative stimuli. You are what you think. Don’t let a major event like cancer change the way you think. It’s only bad if you think it’s bad. What you focus on after can really provide a reset button to the turmoil of feelings. How does this relate to deep work? Simple. If you spend enough time in a state of depth, then you will view your world as more enriching and meaningful. You will be able to constantly be in a state where you can ignore the smaller things that occur in life that populate the lives of shallow workers. This will allow you to be more efficient in life. Neurologically speaking, a day driven by shallow work will be one that will probably be draining and upsetting. This is why being in a state of depth will drive greater satisfaction and meaning to your working life.
- Psychological Argument: A group of psychologists surveyed a sample of people to test when they were feeling the best in the day. The study concluded that people feel more satisfaction and enjoyment at work than free time at home. This is because the act of going into a flow state, losing oneself in an activity after intense concentration, is simply rewarding. This theory is agnostic towards the content of the person’s attention and solely focused on the enriching experience provided by going deep. Build your working life around the experience of flow produced by deep work.
- Philosophical argument: Two well known philosophical professors wrote a book which explores how sacredness has evolved over time. In it, they mention how after the post-enlightenment, people have started tasking themselves to identify what’s meaningful and what’s not meaningful. This embrace of an autonomous life is inevitably boring and nihilist in nature. In contrast, they noted how the craftsman doesn’t decide which parts of the objects he crafts are valuable, but rather cultivates the ability to extract the inherent value from the object. Even in today’s society, this sort of unique experience can happen in any job. Too often, we are caught up in our job descriptions. This is the fault that prevents one from experiencing the same thing as the craftsman. Rather, one needs to realize that they don’t need a rarified job; they need a rarified approach to their work. One thing noticeable about the craftsman is that to be able to extract value, he has to be in a state of depth to cultivate his skill.
- A deep life is a good life, any way you look at it.

### The Rules

### Work deeply

- I use the rhythmic approach to deep work. Every morning I wake up and start my deep work session. I employ a calendar to track my progress and keep me motivated
- I also use the 4DX rules for deep work. Focusing on the wildly important, acting on lead measures(in this case, the amount of hours devoted to deep work), keeping a compelling scoreboard(my calendar with number of hours spent on deep work everyday), and creating a cadence of accountability(reviewing my deep work hours every week to see what i can improve on)
- Setting a shut down time and ritual

### Embrace boredom

- Insignificant actions like checking your phone in line or looking at social media sporadically can counteract your efforts to improve your ability to go deep
- Schedule internet blocks to minimize the effort of switching from a high intensity task to a low intensity task. In line, just wait and be bored - it’s novel.
- Impose artificial deadlines on yourself as it can allow you to work in a state of intense concentration and avoid distraction
- Productive meditation can help reinforce the attention muscles. On a walk, think of the relevant variables to a problem you have. Define the question for how you can solve the problem using the variables. Then, consolidate your solution by reviewing the answer you found. Be aware of distracting thoughts(just gently remind yourself that you can return to that thought later) and looping(mind looping through info you know and not finding new solutions)
- Mind palace technique is also good for memorizing. Rote is bad.
- When eliminating shallow work, a question you have to ask yourself to judge the value of work is: “How long would it take(in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?” Once I figure out where my current activities fall within this shallow-deep scale, I’ll bias myself more towards the latter.
- Schedule every minute of your work day. Use the left column of journal for time slots(1 line represents 30 min) and right side for batched tasks for a box.
- When sending emails or texts out, in a professional context, ask yourself this: “What is the ‘project’ represented by this message, and what is the most efficient(in terms of messages generated) process for bringing this ‘project’ to a successful conclusion?” Project of course can be anything like coffee, a meeting, or research. Even when crafting a new email, make sure there is clarity in the message(no ambiguity), why the message makes sense(why the receiver would even comply to your message), and the receiver doesn’t have to do much to respond.



## How To Win Friends And Influence People

### Part One : Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

### Chapter 1: “If you want to gather honey, don’t kick over the beehive”

- Examples of notorious villains not repenting or apologizing for their actions, but justifying that they were in the right and everyone else wrong. This is significant because if villains don’t see their own actions as wrong, then the question is do ordinary people see things the same way. This turns out to be true as shown by a case study where a manager didn’t condemn workers for not wearing their helmets and instead tried to understand why they didn’t wear the helmets and remind them that helmets are there to protect them. This act of understanding caused greater amounts of workers to wear the helmet
- So as can be seen, people only care about themselves and how they can justify their actions. Therefore, to become better at dealing with people, you want to not condemn others for their actions but seek to understand why they did a wrong action.
- In the case that you are being condemned, don’t immediately seek to justify yourself but seek to understand why the accusers think what they think. This way, you can learn some things that you might’ve been doing wrong and it shows you are a very likable individual.
- Another example is where the father constantly scolds the child despite feeling regret and remorse inside for doing so. But one day, the child timidly walks into the fathers study room. The father immediately gets impatient and asks “what do you want”. The child jumps into the fathers arms and kisses and quickly runs away. It is here that the father has an epiphany about the awful feelings he has whenever he scolds his child and he vows to never do so again
- The last example is the pilot one where a pilot stops flying because he notices something off about his plane. His intuition is correct and the person who fueled his plane put jet fuel instead of plane fuel. He of course is angry and goes to the plane station the next day to confront the fueler. But contrary to how most individuals would respond to the situation, angry at the fact that this mistake could’ve cost a few lives, the pilot goes up to the nervous fueler and pats him on the back and says: “look, I know you won’t make a mistake like this next time so tomorrow, why don’t you install my plane fuel?”
- Principle: don’t condemn, criticize, or complain

### Chapter 2: The big secret of dealing with people

- Examples of how bad and good people both desire feelings of importance. Rockefeller got this feeling through helping poor people he never met. Gang members get this feeling through newspaper featuring them.
- Of course, there’s flattery and appreciation. Flattery is insincere and easy to spot because you’re not really present and just seeking to embellish. Appreciation is sincere and universally accepted and it comes from your heart because of small things you notice about them
- Example: a blind man(Stevie wonder) was asked to find a rat in a room since hem was gifted with innate superior hearing. The person who asked him offered sincere appreciation for his help and his ability to hear so well. This appreciation was a spark of inspiration that led him to pursue a legendary music career
- Example: rockefeller’s friend started a venture which failed and lost a million dollars. Instead of criticizing him or mentioning the massive loss, Rockefeller told his friend to look on the bright side: he retained 60% of what he lost which is pretty good considering rockefellers own failed ventures
- Example: A janitor is often mocked for doing his job poorly. But one day when he does a good job, his superior tells him how good he did that day. Following that, as he starts doing better work, he gets more appreciation from others
- Principle: give honest sincere appreciation

### Chapter 3: He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walls a lonely path.

- To persuade others, you first have to put yourself in their perspective, their shoes. You want to talk about what they want, how it will benefit them, rather than what you want.
- You want to make them feel important: less in approbation and more in lavish praise
- Example: author’s rent about to increase but he talks to the manager and details how by not increasing his rent, more and more people will come for his lectures, which is good for the hotel. This effectively causes the manager to change his mind without losing any of his pride since the author only talked about how it would benefit the hotel.
- Example: Rockefeller bet that he could make the sons of a mother respond to his mail. Before this, the sons had pretty much forgotten about their ill mother and didn’t respond to her letters since it didn’t trigger any desire of theirs. Rockefeller recognized something the boys wanted, money, and appealed to this desire through sending a letter saying he would attach 5$ for each of them. In reality, he purposely didn’t attach the money to solicit out a response from them. A few days later, the boys did respond, thanking Rockefeller for his kind letter but also mentioning how he didn’t attach the money, something they clearly want
- Example: appealing to companies can be quite difficult but one of the people part of the program in this book actually got 11 of 12 companies to give her offers. She did this through writing a letter to them stating how her skills could be of benefit to the company and not talking anything about what she wants.
- Another thing is self expression, shown by an example of a kid who refuses to eat cereal for breakfast. The parents responded through letting the child make the cereal that morning and that form of self expression actually triggered an impulse to eat cereal. So self expression is quite powerful in persuasion as getting the person to invest in something makes them more likely to listen
- Example: a kid doesn’t want to go to kindergarten. The parents think of what the child would want and end up playing a fun game that kindergarten kids would play. The kid comes down and sees how fun the game is and asks to join. He is refused since he doesn’t know how to play the game and the only way to learn is through kindergarten. The next morning, the kid wakes up earlier than his dad and says that he is excited to go to kindergarten
- Principle: arouse in the other person an eager want

### Part Two : Six Ways to Make People Like You

### Chapter 1: Do this and you’ll be welcome everywhere

- Theodore Roosevelt was very well known by his valet and servants. He would memorize the names of every one of them and remember certain things about them. Even if he didn’t see them, he would call out their names as he passed by their quarters
- Remembering the birthdays of other people is a great way to show genuine interest. To do this, ask whether they believe the month of birthday is associated with disposition. Then get the birthday
- Example: an old man who wants to learn the fiddle begins his journey by asking well known fiddlers in his neighborhood about the fiddle. By doing so, he shows interest in their work and makes many friends
- Example: oil company wants to sell oil but a chain company is monopolizing the fuel that is being bought. To better understand why this is happening, the boss simulated a debate and takes the negative(arguing against the affirmative-chain companies are bad). To do this, he visits a chain company and asks to speak to the manager to discuss a few points about why chain companies are good. This debate sparks interest in the manager who talks for an hour about why his chain company is doing a good service to the world. The boss is shown a warm exit and asked to visit again after the debate and is offered to get his fuel bought. This shows how by not talking about his fuel and being interested in the chain company’s oil, the boss was able to learn a new perspective and gain his goal without asking for it.
- Principle: become genuinely interested in other people

### Chapter 2: A simple way to make a good first impression

- Example: greeting coworkers with a smile and “how are you” tends to leave a good first impression
- Example: a man smiled to at least 5 people a day to see its effects. It changed his stale relationship with his wife and improved the quality of his life as he smiled to the people on the elevator and at work. People noticed the changes immediately and said how they now felt like he was likable.
- Actions can influence the will(it is commonly understood the will begets action). So just acting cheerful can induce happiness
- There is also the philosophy that there is nothing good or bad but it is people who see them as good or bad. So if you don’t categorize things, then you won’t see things like that. The stoic philosophy
- Example: managers who hire applicants usually are cold on the phone. This one applicant was offered multiple places to work but chose one on the lower end and when asked why by the smily manager, the applicant said that it was because the manager was the warmest
- Principle: smile

### Chapter 3: If you don’t do this, you’re headed for trouble

- Andrew Carnegie was well known for remembering the names of his workers and those he worked with. He would go to great lengths to remember their names, fixing the person’s attribute to their name. In one instance, he was able to strike a deal with an opposing railway company through naming the combined company that they planned to make the name of the other company’s owner. Naming things based on the names of others is a great way to develop friendship
- Roosevelt also remembered names, a key to his success. If he didn’t hear their name clearly, he would ask them to repeat it. If it was a hard to say name, he would ask how to spell it.
- Saying hard names that others would normally abbreviate is a good way to develop rapport
- Even old figures like Napoleon made it a need to remember names of those he met. In isolation, he would write the name on a piece of paper and fix it firmly in his mind
- Principle: remember that to a person their name is the sweetest and most important sound in any language

### Chapter 4: An easy way to become a good conversationalist

- Being a good listener is key to mastering the art of conversation
- You don’t even have to talk. Just get the other person to invest by asking questions about things they are passionate about
- Example: a 14 year old kid was interested in great figures so he read an autobiography of those people. After, he mailed them asking questions about their childhood and if it was really true. These famous figures actually mailed back and the kid was invited to some dinners and treated as a welcome guest to many of their houses.
- Example: dealing with angry customers can be quite difficult. To deal with them effectively, this manager actually sat down with the customer and listened to the customer as he complained and rambled about his problems. The manager sympathized and agreed with his points. Actually listening to the grievances of others is one way to develop a good friendship
- Don’t be a person who interrupts people while they are giving their story or doesn’t listen to what the other person is saying
- Other people are inherently more interested in their problems and wants than your problems and wants
- Principle: be a good listener, encourage them to talk about themselves

### Chapter 5: How to interest other people

- Roosevelt took the time to actually learn about other peoples interest
- Talking about that 1000000 dollar check and how it came to be is good
- The secretary story: a man wanted to get close to a wealthy businessman for a job. However, that businessman was very reclusive towards job applicants. First, the man found out what interested the businessman through talking with people who knew him: power and money. Second, he met with the businessman’s secretary to discuss how he would help the man earn money. The secretary, enticed, scheduled an appointment with the man and that was very successful as he talked about how he would help the businessman achieve what he wanted. This would have never happened if not for him knowing what the businessman really wanted
- Principle: talk in terms of the other person’s interest

### Chapter 6: How to make other people like you instantly

- Jesus said it many years ago: do onto others how you would wants others to do onto you
- Example: a person was very interested in a famous figure. He wrote a book about that famous figure and his admiration for that figure. This caught the attention of the figure and the person was invited to the house
- Example: Sincerely compliment a person’s valuables. In a story, a person complimented the house of an old man and how nice it looked. The old man said how nowadays, young men don’t appreciate the beauty of houses and he went on talking for an hour. Then, he gifted the person with some chairs.
- Example: Teacher moves a shy and quiet student into an advanced class. When the student cries and questions if he’s good enough, the teacher responds yes.
- Example: Sincerely telling a person that you really need them can revoke a resignation letter. This is what happened when a boss realized that a key worker of his was going to resign due to his lack of skills in treating her. He sincerely professed how he really needed her in the company and apologized and invited her to a meal
- Talk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours
- Principle: Make the other person feel important and do it sincerely

### Part 3: how to win people to your way of thinking

### Chapter 1: You can’t win an argument

- Example: our narrator was once a very argumentative person who was enrolled in debate classes. This caused him to always be defensive towards his positions. One night at a dinner, he got into a scuffle with a person who said a quote was from a bible when it really wasn’t. The best way to resolve this is not to point it out but just say, “Yes. That is from the Bible”. The man didn’t ask for you to appoint yourself as an arbiter of correctness nor do you need the sense of self importance gained from it.
- The best way under high heaven to win an argument is to avoid it. Nothing good ever comes out of an argument. Even if you win an argument, you still lose. Choose between an academic victory or the goodwill of your opponent. If you want the latter, then don’t argue
- Welcome the disagreement. Distrust your natural reaction. Listen closely and try to pinpoint areas of agreement to talk about. Express that you really do care about his thoughts. Thank him for having the same interests as you.
- When one person yells, the other should listen. There is no communication when two people are yelling, just noise and bad vibration.
- Principle: the only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it

### Chapter 2: a sure way of making enemies- and how to avoid it

- Diplomacy is key to this. The self control needed to actually not point out a person is wrong and hurt his or her ego but to carefully speak with tact. If you think someone is wrong, say “well look. I may be wrong and I often am wrong when it comes to matters like this but I think that...” this gives the other person room to admit error since you’re being so kind and generous in your approach
- A lot of the time, we never really understand what the other person says. We listen and form evaluations(nice, bad) about the other person’s statements. What we should actually do is seek to understand what the statement really means to the other person. We’re so quick to point out their errors without understanding why they made it in the first place. For the draperies example, a friend of the narrator came over to look at the new drapery. The price was mentioned and he spoke the hard truth: the drapery wasn’t worth the amount of money spent. This causes the narrator to defend himself. The next day another friend comes over who admires it and says that he wishes he could also afford such an exquisite drapery. The narrator’s attitude completely changes as he admits to his error of paying too much to buy it
- Ben Franklin mastered the art of talking to people which can be seen in his legendary biography. He used to be a very know it all person who made sure to set all the facts straight as he talked with people. This made him unlikable and one of his friends told him this one day and he accepted this truth graciously. He resolved to change himself and forbid himself from using dogmatic phrases like “I’m certain” and making sure to always talk with tact: “I conceive, I imagine, it might be like this”. He found that this made a world of a difference as he talked with people and conversations sailed more smoothly.
- Other notable people like a high positioned general in the military showed signs of knowing this as well. When asked who he admired most, he mentioned one of the officers below him. This surprised the asked as the officer was the most rebellious person on his squad who hated the general. The general responded that you asked me what I felt of him, not what he felt of me.
- Examples of diplomacy: a dealership sends an agent out to figure out some complaints. The agent doesn’t immediately point out the buyer is wrong in is evaluation but hears the buyer out and asks questions on what he thinks is wrong about their material. The agent leads the buyer to the conclusion that he is wrong and the buyer asks the agent on his thoughts. This ends resolved.

### Insights from the rest of the book

- Principle: show respect for the other person’s opinion, never say you’re wrong
- If you’re wrong, admit it
- Beat the other person to it and blaming yourself will often lead to goodwill
- Begin in a friendly way when talking to people. This holds especially true if you have an issue you want resolved from that person. Lincoln said “a drop of honey attracts more flies than a gallon of gall”. Friendliness sets up a good mood in which the other person is willing to help you out.
- Get the other person saying yes yes immediately. Keep getting admission after admission through talking more on areas you agree on. Ask questions in which they have no choice but to agree
- Let the other person do the great deal of talking. Let them excel you: that way they feel important. They would much rather talk about their achievements rather than hear your own. Only talk about yourself when they ask
- Let the other person feel that the idea you are trying to express is his or her’s idea. Instead of selling something to them, let them sell themselves to it. You can do this by asking for their input on the matter and calibrating to their desires.
- Try honestly to see things from the other person’s POV. Just mastering this alone can be a huge stepping stone in my career. This will help me make less enemies and understand others better as their actions always have some kind of meaning behind them.
- Be sympathetic to the other person’s ideas and desires. Everyone just wants someone who can understand them and they crave this sympathy. This goes in tandem with seeing things from the other person’s POV and will definitely improve my character. I can say phrases like “I don’t blame you one iota for feeling as you do. If I were you, I would undoubtedly feel as you do.” Sympathize with people who are often hot headed and say “There but for the grace of God go I”
- Appeal to the nobler motives like mothers(my mother doesn’t want that) or the other person’s dignity. Make them in charge of the thing at hand and make sure they feel content with it
- Dramatize your ideas. That is one way to get someone to do something you want them to do
- Throw down a challenge. People love a good challenge that’s related to their work so they can have a chance for self expression and self worth.
- When you need to find fault, make sure to start with praise and honest appreciation. This way, when you give the unpleasant words, they won’t find it as unpleasant after hearing pleasant words.
- Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly. Also, never use the word “but” after saying words of praise. This will seem like a manipulative way to get someone to do something. Instead, use “and” so it sounds like a continuation of the praise
- Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. By admitting a mistake yourself, it makes it easier for the other person to admit theirs.
- Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. People don’t like being ordered which makes suggesting something to do a much more comfortable choice.
- Let the other person save face.
- Praise the slightest improvement and every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise. When praising, make sure it’s specific so it comes off as sincere. Encouraging others like this will help them realize their latent potential and spur them to success
- Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Even if they don’t have those traits, still give the traits to them. This way, they’ll feel the need to perform as if they had those traits



## The Slight Edge

### Chapter 1: The beach bum and the millionaire

- Millionaire is just a metaphor for success: what you should really think about is not financial success but rather a million dollar smile, a million friends, millions of dollars worth of joy, love, contentment, fulfillment, passion
- The same activities that help us get from failure to survival are the same activities that can help us go from survival to success. We just have to keep doing them

### Chapter 2: The first ingredient

- Actions create result. This is a value driven approach, not an entitled approach of "Pay me more and I'll do more"
- Your philosophy is *what you know, how you hold what you know, and how it affects what you do*
- Successful people fail their way to the top. Do the thing and you shall have the power

> I have not failed. I've simply discovered ten thousand ways that don't work - Thomas Edison

- Philosophy → Attitudes → Actions → Results → Life

### Chapter 3: The choice

- A dying father offers his 2 children a choice: they can either have 1 million dollars or 1 penny. The boy who takes the million spends it without a care in the world and ends up losing it all. The other boy who takes the penny lets it keep growing every day and one day, the boy has a million dollars and counting. 
  - This principle of compound interest is what Einstein calls the 8th wonder
- The slight edge is either working for you or against you. So stop waiting and start acting.
- It's never too late to start. It's always too late to wait.
- Have faith in the process of simple, positive actions repeated over time. The small things really do make a difference.
- Start thinking about your daily decisions and whether they align with your philosophy.

### Chapter 4: Master the mundane

> Yet the world was chock full of people exactly like this delightful shoeshine woman—people with their private hopes and dreams, and with all the marvelous personalities and attributes and inborn abilities they needed to realize those dreams, yet whose pathways forward failed to take them where they were hoping to go. People who already had so much going for them

- Measure success in every aspect of your life: vibrant health, plenty of good friends, people who are full of energy and curiosity, always learning new things and excited about life.
- Perseverance is a great substitute for talent.
- It is the steady, repeated action of water that can wear even the hardest rock down to a smooth surface
- A good rule in life: live below your means 
  - Parkinson's law: "Work expands to fill the time time available for its completion". Financially, this means "Whatever I have, I spend that plus a little more". This is very true since we tend to overestimate how much time we need for something, in this case, money. If we gave ourselves less time for a task and treated things as a deadline, we would be working much smarter and faster
- Unsuccessful people choose the path of least resistance. Despite the actions needed for success being easy to do, most people won't since it's so easy to skip over them
- The factors that create success in the long term aren't apparent in the short term. Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal
- The actions that create success seem insignificant. Most people think that what they do right now doesn't matter, but it does. What you do now and every day matters.

### Chapter 5: Slow down to go fast

- The power of time is all you need to direct your life on the right path
- Time magnifies those small and seemingly insignificant things you do every day into something unstoppable in the future, either good or bad. Therefore, you can choose to have either good or bad habits, knowing what the final result will be compounded over time.
- The natural progression of life: you plant, cultivate, and harvest. But today, society is all about instant gratification; essentially, everyone wants to go from planting to harvesting. This is the reason why so many people give up before they can even see the results of their labor. Cultivating is all about doing actions persistently and daily and it can only happen over time.
- The slight is edge is boring. There is no immediate feedback. But over time, you will start to see results. It's a matter of knowing that results will happen and having faith in the process.
- Your everyday choices should be looked at through the eyes of time, not through the eyes of evidence. You won't be able to see results happening at first.

> Simply by making those right decisions, or making more of them — one at a time, over and over again — you will have enlisted the awesome power of the slight edge on your behalf. The unwanted circumstances, the poor results you've produced in the past, and the evidence of failures in your life, may all continue for a time. There may be no light at the end of the tunnel, or at least none you can see today. But by putting time on your side, you've marshaled the forces of the slight edge. Your success becomes invincible. You just need to stay in the process long enough to give it a chance to win. It starts with a choice

- Most people lived with one foot tucked tightly in the past and another timidly into the future, never fully present in the moment. The slight edge is all about being in the present: being aware of the choices you make, the people you talk to, the foods you eat,  the books you read, etc.
- Your philosophy is your view of how things are. A good philosophy would be "If I stay on this road long enough, I'll get the result I'm seeking". It's not about willpower, mood, or feelings. It's about knowing.

### Chapter 6: Don’t fall for the quantum leap

- Luck is preparedness created by doing simple positive small actions daily. It’s the constancy of preparedness that creates opportunity
- The quantum leap of jumping from planting to harvesting without cultivating is a myth
- Wilberforce and Abraham Lincoln spent much of their life failing before slavery laws were passed
- The myth of our culture is the giant step
- the flashes of recognition and overnight success people have are all results of a long and patient process

> You want a miracle, Bruce? Be the miracle

- No success is immediate. No collapse is sudden. They are all the results of the slight edge accruing momentum over time

### Chapter 7: The secret of happiness

- Happiness breeds success, not the other way around
- The way to get the slight edge to work for you is to incorporate happy habits along with it
- Happy habits are simple and easy actions you can do everyday, such as meditating, writing down things you are grateful for, sending a friend a positive message, etc

> Be happy and the reason will appear

### Chapter 8: The ripple effect

- A single committed person can make a huge change in the world
- Every day, we have a ripple effect on others, but it is our choice whether that is positive or negative
- With greater success comes greater responsibility to the world around us

> I want the world to be better because I was here. I want my life, my work, my family to mean something. If you are not making someone else’s life better you are wasting your time. Your life will only become better by helping make others lives better

### Chapter 9: But you have to start with a penny

> The journey of a thousand miles often starts with a single step

- Examples: Stephen King's success was propelled by a novel he finished only after his wife told him that she thought it was worth continuing after he threw it in the trash basket. Mark Zuckerberg originally made a website for people to rate each other by looks which turned into facebook. Rosa Parks was the catalyst for the new civil rights organization launched by MLK.
- Successful people do what unsuccessful people aren't willing to do: in this case, doing just 1 percent more every day

> A penny saved is a penny earned

- Greatness is always in the moment of the decision
- If you just add 1 percent of anything per day, in a year it will have more than tripled. But you have to start with the 1 percent.

### Chapter 10: Two Life Paths

> I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference

- Your life path is a journey: every moment of the day, curving up or down
- If you're not increasing in your journey, you're decreasing

> Life is a curved construction; time is its builder, and choice its master architect

- Most people in life will be yanking you down because if you succeed, it reinforces the fact that they are not where they want to be
- People on the failure curve have a state of blame. People on the success curve have a state of responsibility

> A man can fail many times but he isn't a failure until he begins to blame somebody else

- Successful people realize their own limitations are self-imposed. They realize that it isn't what happens to them that's important but how they respond to what happens that makes the difference between success and failure
- People on the success curve focus on the future, the macro vision, compounded by micro actions
- What's uncomfortable now becomes comfortable later
- Self assessment: these are the areas of your life you should be striving to make better 
  - Your health
  - Your happiness
  - Your friendships
  - Your personal development
  - Your finances
  - Your career
  - Your positive impact on the world
- Success in one area breeds success in another

### Chapter 11: Mastering the slight edge

- Mastery is the state of mind that lies at the very beginning, not in reaching the end
- Having knowledge of what you want may feel uncomfortable but is essential towards winning
- You may have been in a situation where you've told your friends about your biggest ambitions and they end up just squirming instead of feeling excited. This is because you are showing them your want(desire), which makes them aware of their want(lack)
- Wanting is tangibly feeling your dreams tugging at your present circumstances
- The size of the problem determines the size of the person 
  - People with huge and vivid dreams are pulled towards their dreams with such force
  - People who give up on their dreams are destined to stay mediocre
- Successful people embrace living uncomfortably in order to attain a life that is genuinely comfortable, not deceptively comfortable, as often the life of the masses are
- Find out what the majority are doing and do the opposite
- For whom do millions actually remember? For whom do millions actually mourn? 
  - For those who will do what others are not willing to do.
  - It is for those who we erect statues.
  - Ripple effect and true mastery

## [Advanced iOS App Architecture - RayWenderLich](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/advanced-ios-app-architecture)

### Chapter 2: Which architecture is right for me

- Good architecture helps improve team velocity and fragile code quality, as well as preventing rigid software
- There are 2 fundamental causes for bad architecture: highly interdependent code and large types
  - Highly interdependent code: code in one type reaches out to other concrete types. One part of your code depends on another
  - Large types: Classes, structs, protocols, and enums that have long public interfaces due to many public methods or properties
- Class implementations should not be too long. Think about it this way: if a new engineer comes in tomorrow and needs to understand what 1 view controller does, what percentage of the app's codebase does the new developer need to understand?
- The more objects that depend on the global state, the less information a developer will have when reading a single file
- Today's world is agile and developers are constantly making changes to codebases so having an architecture that is resilient to change is very important
- To reduce interdependency in codebases, limit object dependencies and make the required dependencies obvious
- Making code reusable, even if you don't need to use it more than once, is good because it helps when shuffling code around and reduces the risk of refactors
- Compile and build times are also dependent on good architecture. Since Swift doesn't use header files, every time a change is made to a file, it has to read through all the Swift files in the entire module again when compiling. By breaking up your project into different modules, unedited modules don't have to be recompiled which speeds up build times
- Good architecture allows you to break user stories into tasks - different kinds of objects needed to build that new feature
- Migrating code from one technology to another is much easier with good architecture since high level types won't be coupled with lower level system implementations ie migrating from NSURLConnection pre iOs7 to NSURLSession post
- Being locked with a specific type of data format is also a problem.
- Since many teams use data driven and lean approaches to app dev - feature flags to A/B test features and to toggle off unfinished features, good architecture makes incorporating feature flags flexible
- UIKit is designed with MVC so starting with MVC is good. You can scale up after
- Clean architecture and ports & adapters are concepts that are high level and abstract but will help in tweaking derived patterns. VIPER and RIBs(uber's take on VIPER) are both derived. Good for apps that have a lot of business logic, not so much presentation heavy
- Unidirectional architecture are all about reactive UIs and state management. Redux(the most used uni pattern), MVI, Flux, RxFeedback are all examples. The one drawback is that most components are interconnected and inflexible
- Elements is a collection of smaller architecture patterns designed to be independent so you can use multiple architecture patterns flexibly.
- General best practices
  - Make sure to have cohesive types - properties and methods that make up a type should have focused responsibilities
  - Multi module apps
  - Loosely coupled parts
  - Managing object dependencies using patterns like dependency injection containers and service locators

### Chapter 4: Objects and Their Dependencies

- Good dependency techniques have these qualities
  - Maintainability: Changing one part of the code base doesn't adversely affect others
  - Testability: Unit and UI tests don't rely on factors you can't control such as the network
  - Substitutability: Able to substitute the current implementation at compile time and runtime. Useful for A/B testing
  - Deferability: Able to defer big decisions - selecting a database
  - Parallel work streams: Different members able to work independently on the same feature without interrupting each other
  - Control during development: Allows developers to quickly iterate by controlling build behavior - sign in would use a fake in memory credential store for testing
  - Minimizing object lifetimes: Developers have to manage less states and makes the app more predictable
  - Reusability: Components can be reused
- Definitions
  - A dependency is an object that another object depends on to work
  - A transitive dependency is the dependency that another dependency depends on
  - The object under construction is the object that depends on the dependency
  - The consumer uses the object under construction
  - These relationships form an object graph
- How do dependencies arise?
  - Refactoring a large class such that it becomes many smaller classes
  - Removing duplicate code
  - Controlling side effects
- Fundamental considerations
  - How will the object under construction get the dependency?
    - From the inside: Global property or instantiation(if it has the same lifetime as the object under construction)
    - From the outside: Initializer argument(passing the dependency as an argument), mutable stored property(setting a property in the object), method
  - Dependency patterns
    - Dependency injection: Provide all dependencies outside the object under construction
    - Service locator: An object used to create and hold onto dependencies. The object would use service locator to make a dependency it needs
    - Environment: Mutable struct that provides all dependencies needed
    - Protocol Extension
  - Dependency Injection
    - Externalizes dependencies to allow control of dependencies outside of the object under construction
    - Types of injection
      - Initializer: Dependencies are passed as a parameter. Best injection type because the dependency can then be stored as an immutable stored property
      - Property: After the OUC(Obj under const) is initialized, the consumer provides a dependency to the OUC by setting a stored property
      - Method: Consumer provides dependencies to the OUC when the OUC calls a method in the consumer. Good if the OUC doesn't need to persist the dependency. Minimizes object lifetimes, which is a good dependency technique mentioned earlier
    - Pairing dependency injection along with protocol types enables substitutability when testing fake types
    - You can conditionally compile code through adding compilation condition identifiers to Xcode's active compilation conditions build setting
    - Runtime substitution can be achieved through wrapping dependency initializations around an if else and setting based on the condition premise
- Dependency injection approaches
  - Quick overview
    - On demand: Creating dependency graphs when needed in a decentralized manner
    - Factories: Centralize initialization logic
    - Single container: Batches all initialization logic into 1 container
    - Container hierarchy: Breaks the big container into smaller containers
  - On demand
    - Consumer creates or finds the dependencies needed by the OUC at the time the consumer instantiates the OUC
    - Ephemeral dependencies are created and destroyed alongside the OUC. Best used if dependencies don't need to live longer than the OUC
    - A reference is created or found to a dependency if it needs to live longer than the OUC
    - Pros
      - Testable since dependencies are easily substitutable since dependencies are wrapped around if else instantiation clauses
      - Deferability: ie start with a memory data store and when you need to switch to a database, replace all instances of in memory instantiations - albeit tedious
      - Parallel work streams
    - Cons
      - Decentralized: same initialization logic is duplicated many times
      - Consumers need to know how to build the entire dependency graph for an OUC: this could result in many dependencies being instantiated and there will probably be multiple consumers using the same OUC, which is duplicating logic
  - Factories
    - Made up of factory methods that can create dependencies and OUCs
    - No state - no stored properties
    - Dependency factory method: create a new dependency instance
      - For an ephemeral transitive dependency: Calls on another dependency factory included in the factories class
      - To get a reference to a long lived transitive dependency: Include a parameter when calling the dependency
      - Typically have a protocol return type to enable substitutability
      - Encapsulates the mapping between protocol and concrete types through resolution
    - OUC factory methods
      - Creates the dependency graph needed to instantiate an OUC
      - Called outside of the factories class
    - Some OUCs and dependencies will need runtime factory arguments to function
    - Substituting dependency implementations is similar but better than on demand: you wrap dependency resolutions with a conditional statement once in the factory class and you can use it anywhere
    - The problem with factories is that every time they are called, a new instance is created
      - This is solved in 2 ways
        - Closures
          - Declare a stored property in the OUC - let a: () → UseCase
          - Add an initializer parameter to the OUC with the same closure type
          - Go to the factories class and create a new closure in the OUC factory method that will call a dependency factory method and return the new instance
          - Pass this as a parameter to the initializer call
          - Benefits
            - This is good because the OUC can create as many instances of the factory dependency as it wants without knowing all the transitive dependencies behind the dependency created
        - Protocols
          - Define a new factory protocol that contains a single method which returns the dependency the OUC needs
          - Add a stored property and initializer parameter of the protocol type in the OUC
          - Go back to the factories class and to the OUC's factory method and update the initialization line to inject self.self as the new factory protocol you declared
    - Pros
      - Ephemeral dependencies are created in a central place allowing you to change code in 1 place for all
      - Substitutability since all dependencies are initialized in one class
      - Consumers are more resilient to change since they no longer need to know how to build the dependency graphs
    - Cons
      - A single factory class can become extremely large in a bigger app
      - Only works for ephemeral objects. Long lived objects need to be held somewhere else
  - Single container approach
    - A factories class with stored properties for holding onto long lived dependencies
    - Dependency factory methods
      - For creating an ephemeral transitive dependencies through calling another dependency factory - same as factories approach
      - For reference to a long lived transitive dependency, this approach gets the dependency from a stored property
        - This means there are no parameters for calling a method
    - OUC factory methods
      - Like dependency factory methods, these factory methods don't need any parameters for long lived dependencies which lessens the things consumers have to manage
      - Also abstracts the process since consumers can create OUCs without knowing anything about dependency graphs behind the objects
    - Long lived dependencies can be easily substituted by wrapping their initialization line with a conditional statement
    - Containers should only have 1 instance - singleton
    - Pros
      - Manages the entire app's dependency graph, abstracting the need for other code to know how to build object graphs
      - The container itself manages the singleton
      - Code is centralized so dependency graphs are changed within the class
    - Cons
      - Can result in massive container class
  - Container hierarchy approach
    - Some issues that arise in the single container approach is that as more features are added to a product, more dependencies are added. There will be a lot of optional conditional unwrapping. Consumers could have access to reusable dependencies when a user isn't signed in
    - Object scopes
      - Scopes help create and destroy objects by defining a lifetime
      - App scope
        - Created at app launch and destroyed when app is killed
        - Authentication stores, analytics trackers, logging systems
      - User Scope
        - Created when user signs in and destroyed when user signs out
        - Remote APIs and data stores
      - Feature scope
        - Created when the user navigates to a certain feature and destroyed when the user navigates away
        - Uber pick me up feature - location is fetched once and then not retrieved again
        - Interaction scope
          - Created when a gesture is recognized and destroyed when the gesture ends - short lived scope
    - Every scope should have a container class
    - Designing a container heirarchy
      - Rule: A child container can ask for the dependencies from its parent container all the way to the root container but the parent container cannot ask for a dependency from the child container
        - Reason: A parent container lives longer than a child container so there could be a call where the child container might not exist anymore
      - Child containers need to be provided with parents containers with initializer injection
      - Capturing data
        - A container can capture data model values by converting mutable values to immutable values
        - Makes the code more deterministic because there is no need to consider a change in the captured value. New values will just replace the captured value
      - Pros
        - Scoping allows dependencies that aren't singletons to exist
        - Mutable values can be converted into immutable values
      - Cons
        - More complex
        - Complex apps can end up with long container classes
