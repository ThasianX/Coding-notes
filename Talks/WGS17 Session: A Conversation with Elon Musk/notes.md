# [WGS17 Session: A Conversation with Elon Musk](https://youtu.be/rCoFKUJ_8Yo)

- Life is about trying to understand the right questions to ask
    - Increasing the scope and scale of the human consciousness will better help us ask these questions
- Certain things are necessary to ensure the future is good
    - Long term sustainable energy
    - Sustainable transport
    - Space bearing civilization
    - Multi planetary species
        - Necessary for the survival of humankind in the future
        - Creates a sense of adventure
        - Makes people excited about the future
        - Consider two futures: one where we are confined to Earth until something terrible happens or another one where we are out there on many planets and going beyond the solar system
        - There needs to reasons to get up in the morning
        - Life just can't be about solving problems
        - There's got to be things that people find inspiring and make life worth living
- Hopes for the future
    - We are out there on Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
    - We are traveling frequently throughout the solar system
    - Preparing for missions to nearby star systems
    - All of this is possible within 50 years
- Why is Deep Artificial intelligence dangerous?
    - Having an AI that is much smarter than the smartest person on Earth just isn't safe
    - It will basically be like an alien
- Aliens
    - If there are aliens, they are probably already observing us and we're just not smart enough to realize it
    - Pocket calculations
        - Any advanced alien civilization that was at interested in populating the galaxy  even without exceeding the speed of light could populate the entire galaxy within 10 to 20 million years
        - This is nothing in the grand scheme of things
- Solution to urban congestion
    - A network of tunnels under cities
        - Tunnels that go many levels deep
        - You can always go deeper than you can go up
        - For example, the deepest tunnels are deeper than the tallest buildings
    - The challenge
        - How do you figure out how to build tunnels quickly, with low cost, and safely?
- What's the next disturbance in technology?
    - Most near term
        - Autonomous cars
            - It's going to slowly put drivers and people out of jobs
            - We need to figure out roles for these people to do
    - Eventually we're going to need some kind of universal basic income
        - There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better
        - The output of goods and services will be high
        - Thus, there will be an abundance and goods and items will become cheap
    - The real question is then how do people have meaning?
        - Many people derive meaning from their employment
        - If there's not a need for your labor, what's your meaning?
        - How do we ensure the future is going to be a future that we want and will still like?
    - Having some sort of merger with biological intelligence and machine intelligence
        - The concept
            - Tertiary layer - limbic system
            - Cortex layer - brain
            - Digital layer
                - If someone dies, their digital ghost is still around - their social media posts and emails - will still be around
        - The bandwidth is important
            - The speed of the connection between your brain and the digital extension of yourself
            - You could input commands to your phone using your brain
        - High bandwidth interface to the brain will help achieve symbiosis between human and machine intelligence
            - Could solve the control and usefulness problem
- How do you come up with ideas?
    - Think about what technology solution is necessary in order to achieve that particular goal and then try to make as much progress in that direction as much as possible
- How do you choose your team?
    - Questions
        - Tell me the story of your life and the decisions you made along the way and  why you made them?
        - Tell me about some of the most difficult problems you've worked on and how you solved them?
            - The people who really solve the problem, they know exactly how they solved the problem. They know the little details
            - The people that pretended to solve the problem can go about 1 level and then they get stuck
- How to make progress in things?
    - Best analytical framework for thinking would be thinking process around physics
        - Not just the equations but the way of thinking in physics that allows physicists to understand things that are counterintuitive
    - Always take the position that you are some degree wrong and your goal is to be less wrong over time
    - One of the biggest mistakes we make is wishful thinking
        - You want something to be true if it isn't true
        - You ignore the real truth because of what you want to be true
