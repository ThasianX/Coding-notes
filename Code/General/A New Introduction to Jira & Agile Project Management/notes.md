# [A New Introduction to Jira & Agile Project Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsG3OWTDAFY)

- Jira projects
    - The 'Project' is the highest level container
    - A single issue can only be in one Jira project at a time
    - All of your team's work should be put into 1 Jira project
- Types of Agile
    - Kanban
        - Best for teams that are working on bugs or issues where most issues have an ASAP schedule
        - Focus on rapid assignment
        - Working in the right order, not so much on estimating completion dates
        - Typical flow
            - Collect all the work that needs to be done
            - Put the work in the right order
            - Assign and complete the work as fast as possible
    - Scrum
        - Best for teams that are working on new features with a tight schedule for finishing their work
        - Manage their way towards this target by breaking their work into iterative batches called sprints
            - Usual sprints last 2 weeks
        - When new work is discovered, the existing in progress work is left as it is and new work is added to the next sprint
        - Typical flow
            - Collect all the work that needs to be done
            - Put the work in the right order
            - Define checkpoints for completion of batches of work aka sprints
            - Then reprioritize at each checkpoint
- Agile tasks
    - Breaking work into fragments helps ensure that ownership of every task is clear and teams can reprioritize often
    - Make sure tasks are granular enough to let you reprioritize as often as you discover new things
    - Good guidelines
        - A single agile task should take at least a few horus
        - A single agile task should not take more than 3 days
        - As you begin to master Agile, try making the maximum amount of time for a task 1 day
            - This way, in every stand up meeting, you will always have the ability to say you finished the thing you set out to finish
- Issue Types
    - Stories
        - Usually used by PMs to describe planned work for a specific feature of a product
    - Tasks
        - Usually used by any team member to describe other planned, non-story work
    - Bugs
        - Calls out unplanned work
    - Epic
        - Collection of stories and tasks arranged together to achieve some specific outcome
- Issue fields
    - Story points
        - Useful for estimating work during Scrum planning
    - Labels
        - Are just tags
        - Users can make their own labels on the fly
        - Helps differentiate between different teams
    - Components
        - Are also tags
        - New components must be created by an administrator in Jira's settings section
        - Helps differentiate between modules within a product
- Scrum backlog
    - New Jira issues are put into the backlog
    - You can prioritize your team's work and arrange it into sprints - 2 week delivery batches
- Agile sprints
    - Has a start and end date
    - Often 2 weeks long
    - While active, you shouldn't add new work to the active sprint
- Epics
    - Avoid unfinishable epics like 'Maintenance' and 'Refactoring'
- Story points
    - Relative measure of complexity
    - Helps overcome the inherent uncertainty of estimating while still creating a useful quantifier for the items in the backlog
    - Use estimation points of: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
        - Fibonacci numbers are often used because when tasks are small, your ability ot imagine exactly what you'll do is fairly accurate
        - But when tasks get bigger, your ability to estimate gets worse and worse. And at this scale, the difference between a 11, 12, 13, or 14 is pretty much irrelevant
        - Fibonacci numbers map nicely to this error in estimation
    - Helps with measuring team velocity
    - Guidelines for new teams
        - 1 point: 2-3 hours for a task
        - 13 points: 3 days for a task
- Jira work flows
    - All tasks in the project should go through all the steps(columns) of the workflow
    - Users should be able to see all the columns of the workflow, so keep the number of steps to 7 or less
