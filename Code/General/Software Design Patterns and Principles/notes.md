# Software Design Patterns and Principles

- Software patterns offer ways to accomplish certain behaviors within a program and benefit programmer communication
- All patterns are justified by principles
- Important principles
    - D.R.Y. - Don't Repeat Yourself
        - Don't rewrite the same block(s) of coed in various places as you will have to change it in multiple places if refactoring is needed
    - Y.A.G.N.I - You Ain't Gonna Need It
        - Implement only what is absolutely necessary
        - Think of the big picture and not of the smaller details
            - Ie the UI can be coded later
    - K.I.S.S. - Keep It Stupid Simple
        - Reduce your code's complexity
            - Ie if a certain design pattern overcomplicates things, don't implement it
            - Especially holds true when doing UI design and using APIs
    - P.O.L.A. - Principle Of Least Astonishment
        - Do the least astonishing thing
        - You want other developers to be able to easily understand your code when they first see it
    - S.O.L.I.D.
        - Single Responsibility
            - A class should only have specific functionality for one feature or thing
            - If it changes, it should only change for one reason
        - Open/Closed Principle
            - A class should be open to "extension" but closed for "modification"
        - L. Substitution Principle
            - Subclasses should fit anywhere that their superclass does
        - Interface Segregation
            - Multiple specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface
        - Dependency Inversion
            - Depend on abstractions and not on concrete implementations
                - Abstract classes and interfaces can't be instantiated
