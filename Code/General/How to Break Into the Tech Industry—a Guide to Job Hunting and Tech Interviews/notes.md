# [How to Break Into the Tech Industry—a Guide to Job Hunting and Tech Interviews](https://haseebq.com/how-to-break-into-tech-job-hunting-and-interviews/)

## Part 1: Job hunting

### Networking

- Simply, buy everyone coffee
- Offer template
    - “Hey, that’s really cool. I’m actually trying to get a job as a software engineer. I don’t know very much about [the thing you do]. I’d love to buy you coffee and pick your brain about it. Are you free sometime this week around [time]?”
- Go broke buying people coffee
- Plumb your network and reach out to people you may know or cold email people you may not
- When you've sat down with someone for coffee, move onto informational interview

### Informational Interviewing

- Learn everything and anything you can about this person
    - Their company
    - What they do
    - Why they think it's important
- *But don't ask for a job*
- Most often, after they do a lot of the talking initially, they will ask you questions
    - Tell them your story
    - Tell them about who you are
    - Tell them what brought you here
    - Tell them why you want a job as a software engineer
- At the end, go for a close
    - It's not asking for a job referral, unless they bring it up
    - Rather, ask them who else they think would be a good person for you to talk to
        - If they can't think of anyone, ask them if they know any other engineers or anyone at another tech company
        - Just get contacts
- Why this works
    - People hate it when you ask them for a job
    - People love it when you make it about them
        - People like to talk about themselves
        - People like to teach others
        - They want to help but don't want to be pestered by strangers for favors
    - People will believe in your story and want to refer you doing this
        - Reality is, most people can't refer you

### Get the chain started

- Scour your LinkedIn, Fb, family, talk to people you knew
- Make a spreadsheet of every single person you know who works for a tech company - company and role
    - Sort your contacts by company and then by role
    - Reach out to the most relevant person at every single company
        - Invite them to coffee, lunch, dinner
        - Always buy
        - Farm for referrals and more contacts

### Resumes and Cover Letter

- Get your resume reviewed by someone who knows what they're doing
- Keep your resume short
    - 1 page always
    - Highlight anything that sounds technical
    - Measure everything in terms of impact, not responsibilities
    - Make it pretty
    - Don't use Arial or Times New Roman

### Job Platforms

- Set up profiles on
    - AngelList
    - WhiteTruffle
    - SmartHires
    - Etc
- Apply to
    - Triplebyte
    - Hired
- Clean up your
    - LinkedIn
    - Github

### Mass Applying

- Pre-commit to a number of companies to apply to per day
- Apply to batches of companies in sprints

### Company size

- Shoot for unsexy companies
- Having your first offer matters much more than where the offer is from

### General study strategy

- High level roadmap
    - Watch the princeton course on algorithms by Robert Sedgewick
    - Read The Algorithm Design Manual for general algorithms and data structures background
    - Buy Cracking the Coding Interview as it has a good repository of coding problems and solutions
    - Listen regularly to podcasts about software like Software Engineering Daily or The Bike Shed
    - Read Hacker News
    - For system design and architecture, read HiredInTech and blog posts on High Scalability
    - Spend no more than 20-30 minutes on a problem if you don't get it. Google it

### Staying the path

- You're going to get many rejections
- It's going to be demoralizing
- But do things that de-stress you
- Spend more time sleeping
- Get regular exercise

### Mindset

- Treat everything as a learning experience
    - Go to job interviews hoping it'll be interesting, not hoping for a job.
    - Don't care about the outcome
    - Go in and learn
- Continually set goals for yourself
    - Choose goals based on your own behavior
        - "I want to apply to 4 jobs every weekday"
    - Don't choose goals that you can't control
        - "I want to have a job offer by January 20th"

### Your number

- Imagine that somewhere in God's database, is your number
- Everyone has a number. This number represents how many days you're going to have to work your ass off until you find a job
- Every day you spend seriously job searching decreases N by 1
- Other people may have smaller Ns than you, but you don't care because you know that your N is affected by randomness
- Your N is already decided so treat every day as progress but know that for every day you work on it, your N is getting smaller, despite rejections from companies

## Part 2: Interview process

### The basics

- Ask questions about the format of the interview and what kinds of questions will be asked
- Dress nicely but casual
- After shaking the hand of the interviewer and looking him/her confidently in the eye, adopt a relaxed body language
- Think to yourself that this interview is just for practice anyway. Don't analyze yourself
- Ask your interviewer what team he/she's on and what he/she's been working on lately to get the conversation flowing

### Talking about yourself

- What's your story/ walk me through your resume?
    - Consider yourself a character in a story and structure the story with a beginning, middle, end.
    - There should be inflection points, characterization, and easy to understand motivations.
    - Frame your story around seeking challenge and wanting to better yourself
- Precrafted answers for questions
    - Why us?
    - Tell me about a challenging bug you faced and how you solved it.
    - Tell me about an interesting project you worked on.

### How to approach the interview problem

- Always repeat back the question in your own words
- Assume that you will misunderstand what they're asking
- Start with the whiteboard
- Throw in some edge cases
- Keep talking
- Verbally verify your assumptions about the input
- Analyze the algorithm time complexity and space complexity
- Talk about tradeoffs

### Grill your interviewer

- Ask them why they decided to join the company
- Ask them what they think the company could improve on
- Ask them about a time they messed up and how it was handled
- Ask them how they see themselves growing at this company in the next few years
- Ask them what they wish someone would have told them before they joined
- Ask them if they every think about leaving, and if they were to leave, where they would go
